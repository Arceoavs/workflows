Inside, six two-tops press close together along one wall with an eating shelf opposite, usually offering an empty stool or two if you despair of acquiring a table. A prep counter at the end of the room flaunts a luscious collection of fruit, including oodles of ripe bananas.", "Where micro-eateries are concerned, breakfast is the new profit center, and Dimes begins that meal at the eye-rubbing hour of 8 a.m. There's a quasi-conventional two-egg breakfast and a spectacular breakfast sandwich made with fluffy scrambled eggs piled high on a roll with cheddar, sliced avocado, and sweet-pickled jalapenos ($6.50). Further afield find a bowl of orange-date muesli splotched with yogurt and also a chia-seed pudding that manages to incorporate hemp and buckwheat.", "There are excellent breakfast tacos\u2014 presented in authentic Austin fashion on flour tortillas\u2014but most of Dimes' leggy and attractive patrons had their noses deep in acai bowls ($9 each). These cold soups are based on a purple berry puree shipped frozen from Brazil and reported to have medicinal properties. And they turn out to be unexpectedly tasty. All contain bananas, along with other seemingly random ingredients, among them lavender, goji berries, bee pollen, cashew cream, and coconut. In case that seems too healthy, you can also have sausage or bacon on the side for an extra couple of dollars, and wash it all down with the establishment's industrial-strength coffee.", "Breakfast is served till 4 p.m., and there's also a lunch menu offering meal-size salads, grain concoctions, and sandwiches. Some of the lunches are remarkably transgressive, while remaining fruit and vegetable intensive. Amplified with avocado, arugula, juice-dripping roasted tomatoes, more of those sweet jalapenos, and lime-cilantro mayo, the BLT ($11) is a thing of beauty that will also burn your mouth off. And the bacon is piled on with a generous hand. (No Fakin' Bacon here.) There's an oddball banh mi made with Tuscan-style chicken livers, and a marvelous salad featuring cantaloupe, kale, and raw tomatillos \u2013 three ingredients that have probably never been in such close proximity before.", "Acai bowls; Egg sandwich", "But the low-key diversity of breakfast and lunch won't prepare you for the tour-de-force of dinner, when the gals get serious with their menu and its modern obsessions. Composed salads and grains dominate the culinary landscape. Once again playing to a generation not afraid of chiles, an appetizer of roasted peaches ($9) comes engagingly tossed with blistered shisito peppers and toasted pecans. More conventionally, a splendid damp expanse of homemade burrata arrives looking like a runway model clad in heirloom tomatoes in eye-appealing colors. What's weird about Dimes' spin on this frequently seen combo? Oniony nigella seeds and a chile-balsamic dressing in which Italy and Mexico happily meet.", "Atlantic cod in coconut curry", "For diners who insist on normal bistro fare, there's a nicely roasted chicken and a lively stew of cod in curry broth, but why not pick one of Dimes' more atypical entrees? A dish with the discouraging name of spicy quinoa ($14) is anything but disappointing, featuring a miniature mountain of the putative miracle grain topped with a wad of beet relish, with a gorgeous array of fruit and vegetables radiating from it: bright red roasted peppers, wrinkly green asparagus, scattered yellow corn, and purple eggplant singed to a pleasant mush. Even carnivores are likely to writhe in pleasure at the lushness of the culinary landscape.", "Other entrees illustrate the same attention to color and texture, as if each were a 3-D sculpture mounted on a pedestal at MOMA.

Only twenty years ago this hilly city of seven million on the Musi River was in a state of decline, but recently it has undergone an economic uptick that has transformed the city into a tech powerhouse and kingpin of the call-center industry. (Yes, many of those annoying phone solicitations you get around dinnertime come from Hyderabad.) For a South Indian metropolis, it has an unusual history. Hyderabad\u2019s culinary roots go back to the Muslim Mughal emperors of the North, who conquered Hyderabad in 1724. They brought with them some of their most delectable recipes, including biryani, a lamb-dotted rice casserole inspired by Middle Eastern pilaf \u2014 an unusual signature dish for a southern city.", "You can get indifferent biryani in any of New York\u2019s old-fashioned Punjabi restaurants, usually a greasy mountain of rice shot with tough morsels of meat and more raisins than you can shake a stick at. Often, it\u2019s been desiccating on a steam table for days. Instead, whiz over to Hyderabadi Biryani &amp; Chat, a sole Indian establishment among the Northern Chinese cafes and pizzerias of Kissena Boulevard. The restaurant occupies a boxy room with eight tables in the front and a steam table at the far end \u2014 the tubs are filled with things that actually improve with age, like palak paneer and goat masala. The room\u2019s main decoration is a wall-size mural with color photos of the menu, which would make ordering easy if there weren\u2019t so many difficult choices to make at this astonishingly good restaurant.", "Bullet naan and gobi Manchurian", "The biryani is some of the best in town, available in eight varieties. Rather than sitting on the steam table and drying out, it is assembled to order with freshly cooked morsels of meat and vegetables. Two of the choices are vegetarian, one also vegan. The rice is kept exceedingly fluffy, delicately flavored with ginger, garlic, and cardamom. The shards of meat, poultry, or seafood are tender, pleasantly fatty, and cut in pieces smaller than usual, the better to hide among the tan, yellow, and orange grains of rice. Deeply brown caramelized onions and bright green chopped cilantro and scallions are heaped on top; a lime wedge is provided on the side to further irrigate and sour the rice. By all means, squeeze it!", "Maybe not surprisingly if you\u2019re fond of the can-chewing quadruped, goat is a better call than lamb, and cheaper, too ($10.99 vs. $11.99). It\u2019s more pungent and even slightly funky, very flavor-forward. The funniest looking is the egg biryani ($7.99), a vegetarian tour-de-force crowned with ivory ovoid humps of boiled egg. Crush them up roughly and mix them in with the rice before attacking. The most unusual is \"chilli chicken biryani,\" which features boneless poultry fragments colored an alarming shade of red. The chicken comes from Indian-Chinese cuisine (which probably originated in Calcutta\u2019s Chinatown in the 1940s), and this biryani constitutes a fascinating culinary mash-up that you won\u2019t find elsewhere.", "Goat biryani", "While the gigantic menu of Hyderabadi Biryani includes dishes from several regions of India, it spotlights several fascinating recipes from Southern Indian states. Best perhaps is Kerala pepper chicken ($9.99) from the southernmost tip of the South Asian landmass, where fish, coconut milk, and banana leaves figure into the everyday fare. This dish, however, deposits chicken in a bright tomato sauce tinged yellow with turmeric and flavored with aniseed and curry leaf, among many other spices. The main flavoring, though, which makes you sweat from the heat as you gobble the curry, is cracked black peppercorns. Using peppercorns rather than chiles indicates that this recipe probably originated before the 16th century, when the Portuguese introduced chiles to India. Not only is Kerala pepper chicken hot and historical, it\u2019s also supremely delicious.", "Other chicken recipes from Southern India include coconut chicken and chicken Hyderabadi (a variation on Chettinad chicken, invented by an ancient tribe called the Chettinars who, according to legend, migrated from India to Southeast Asia). Another Northern Indian flourish to Hyderabad cuisine is the passion for the yeast-risen flatbreads cooked in the tandoor oven called naans. The caf\u00e9 offers seven; most compelling is the wonderful bullet naan ($1.99), which arrives glistening with oil and paved with minced jalape\u00f1os. They make the bread glow green and burn the heck out of your mouth. Named after a town on the Afghan-Pakistan frontier, Peshwari naan comes studded with dried fruit and nuts \u2014 you could almost eat it as dessert.

How did the meat taste? Couldn\u2019t tell you. The $210, service-included price (before supplements), was too high for this young writer. So it wasn't until a few years later that I got my fix, not at Per Se but at David Chang\u2019s $85 Momofuku Ko, where a high-tech water bath treatment left my short ribs gorgeously pink. There were no supplements at Ko. There was also no coddling. The setting was a cramped East Village counter. The first course was a pork rind.

Ever since Momofuku Ko opened in a small, uncomfortable, and stuffy space in Manhattan\u2019s East Village in 2008, the New York-area set menu venue, as an institution, has slowly been distancing itself from its haute inclinations and more spacious environs.

The modern set menu venue is populated by cooks whose names you might not recognize; they didn't rise to chef de cuisine at Per Se or Cafe Boulud before striking out on their own.

And so it goes that the $75 per person Semilla, located in a part of Williamsburg bereft of $300 denim shops, already ranks near the top of either pack. In fact it\u2019s the only new restaurant in quite some time to merit four stars right out of the gate.", "The composed cheese course, normally a pre-dessert elsewhere, is the first course at Semilla. The waiter hands you a shot glass. Inside it, a cumulus cloud of hot parmesan foam sits atop an inch-high tranche of cool pear soup.

Ramirez-Ruiz, the head chef, dehydrates two leaves of cabbage. This is your bread. In between goes a drippy mess of slaw. The first time I tried it, the creation was unambiguously delicious and straightforward enough to serve at a football party. Then on visit number two, I noticed the exterior had a gentle citrus tang and a subtle jerky-like chew, with buckwheat groats evoking the earthy kasha dinners I enjoyed as a 20-year-old living in Russia. And during my final meal, I detected yet another layer of flavor, this one the flatulent funk of cabbage, like a dry-aged piece of beef disguised as a vegetable (the chef tells me he brushes the leaves with duck fat, which hikes the up the flavor to NC-17 levels). Never has a piece of bluefin tuna infected my culinary daydreams to such a degree as this sandwich, which is, for lack of a better term, a humble piece of food waste.", "Above: Overwintered vegetables with warm creme fraiche and cocoa; bamboo shoot and avocado tart with pickled garlic.

Flesh is never the centerpiece of the plate, but rather a garnish, applied like salt or herbs. Take the shallot tart, a mess of sweet roots atop a pastry crust, with a hint of black truffle, a dab of mornay, and an almost invisible slice of lardo. The result is a shockingly delicious, solid-state French onion soup. Or consider the koji-marinated beet tartare, where little dots of foie gras aioli are interspersed throughout, acting as carnivorous capers to these vegetables posing as beef, and adding a whisper of lusciousness to these low-fat environs.", "All the action takes place at an 18-seat, U-shaped, ash-wood counter, in a room little bigger than a studio apartment. Think of it this way: Semilla is what Brooklyn Fare would look like if it were folded upon itself like a piece of origami. The space feels taller than it is wide, which perhaps explains all the vertically stored dry goods; you might see chef fetch them by standing atop their workspace like culinary trapeze artists.", "The chef prefers to find his luxury in more ephemeral and pedestrian indulgences", "Lucky diners, sitting adjacent the kitchen pass, can watch as Ramirez-Ruiz shaves black truffles over a bowl of scrambled eggs and Carolina rice \u2014 the lone supplement on the menu ($35) and sadly one that won\u2019t be available now that the season is over. Still, the chef prefers to find his luxury in more ephemeral and pedestrian indulgences, like a salad of tuscan kale, mustard greens, and winter sorrel, all topped with a nutty buttermilk cocoa dressing. The delicate leaves are so packed with sugar it almost tastes as if you\u2019re eating a cotton candy salad finished with melted peanut brittle (but with balance).

Jaew is just one of the surprises that lurks around every corner of Lan Larb's menu.", "The heart of the bill of fare are the ground-meat salads called larbs (alternatively known as laaps, larps, or lahbs, according to a footnote on the menu). While most Thais in town offer pedestrian chicken and pork versions, here there are eight, of which the best is made with duck ($11).

Another version, and one not offered at Larb Ubol, is larb nam-tok nuer, featuring beef that's been grilled in strips rather than merely ground and steamed, and hence retains more meaty savor. Any larb comes accompanied by cabbage and cucumbers; one way to eat these larbs is by piling bitefuls on the veggies. Sumpatboon offers competing renditions of som tum, too, the famous shredded green papaya salad prepared with a mortar and pestle, which more effectively releases the aromatic flavors than, say, a food processor.

By the way, there is an exception to the \"curries tend to be bland\" rule at Lan Larb Soho. It's called jungle curry (with mock duck, $12), and you should order it with some caution.

The flaky flatbread almost falls apart and leaves your hands slippery with grease\u2014but if you can maneuver it well enough to grab a fistful of haleem, the taste combination is fantastic.", "This being a self-described kebab house, there are kebabs you've probably never heard of. Tenderest is gola kebab ($10), associated in a menu side note with Karachi, Pakistan's Burns Road, named after Dr. James Burns, an early 19th century British colonial physician. Gola means \"hand grenade,\" which this kebab resembles in shape, if not texture. In fact, finely minced with papaya, yogurt, and spices, the beef is so soft it must be laced together with thread like a girdle. The first thing you should do upon receiving it is carefully remove the thread, which can be quite annoying. Though the gola kebab won't look like a grenade anymore after being unthreaded, it will still explode in your mouth with flavor.", "My table liked nearly every kebab we tried, with the exception of the boti kebab. These lamb chunks marinated in yogurt and then grilled melt into mush in your mouth, proving that, where meat is concerned there can be such a thing as too tender. In chocolate such melting could be an advantage, but with lamb cubes you want something more sinewy.", "Bundu Khan serves virtually nothing but meat\u2014boiled, broiled, fried, or tandoori-roasted\u2014and the South Asian immigrants who come here, the women dressed in sumptuous and colorful outfits, the men in plain sports clothes, are willing to wait outside for it and think nothing of foregoing vegetables entirely for one meal, at least. Chicken is a highlight, too. You can get it sauced in a Delhi-style qorma of medium spiciness; in a glorious, particolored biryani; ground-up in seekh, chapli, or reshmi kebabs; or in boneless or bone-in chicken tikka (order the bone-in for extra flavor). Best of all is chargha ($15) an entire bird laved in lemon juice and what the menu is pleased to call \"Oriental spices.\" The sheer size of the chicken suggests you may be eating the leftovers for days to come.", "Could a vegetarian get by at Bundu Khan? Barely. The tastiest vegetarian curry is chana masala ($7), perfectly cooked chickpeas immersed in dark gravy. Sometimes there's also palak paneer, the familiar casserole of spinach and fresh pressed cheese. But really, the restaurant is set up to encourage orgies of meat consumption, and that is exactly what you should expect.

The town was carved from a tree nursery owned by one M.A. Murray around 1890, but nowadays, most of the land is occupied by trim stuccoed houses and brick apartment buildings, while the balance is mainly small cafes, brightly decorated with colorful signs broadcasting their specialties. In fact, outside of Manhattan's 32nd Street, no place in the five boroughs has a better collection of Korean restaurants.", "Focusing on tabletop barbecue, Mapo occupies a prime corner overlooking the green, where, with springtime upon us, yellow daffodils rise in random clumps. The windows are plastered with banners of bright red meat calculated to set the salivary glands flowing. Inside, there's room for around 50 diners at 10 or so brightly lit tables. Here and there, broad-flanked Black Angus cattle pose in pastures like magazine pin-ups, as if too aware of their intrinsic attractiveness. From a raised platform a manager surveys the room, monitoring the comings and goings of employees dashing around the room like cowpokes, setting up and breaking down barbecues, distributing bottles of beer and platters of raw meat, busing tables, and forestalling groups of diners waiting hungrily in a knot just inside the door.", "", "But why should you venture to this quaint but rather obscure spot rather than going to any other Korean barbecue in town? Two reasons: the place cooks its meat over lump charcoal, imbuing it with smoky savor. And rather than serving flesh in small, unsatisfying portions, as they do it in Manhattan, Mapo delivers saddlebag-size hanks deeply veined with fat, which renders and sizzles as it hits the grill. Here's how a meal goes down.", "Though Mapo is a full service restaurant, there's no doubt barbecue is its raison d'\u00eatre. Unlike the 32nd Street barbecues, which offer perhaps a score of grillable choices, Mapo provides only four, and selecting which to get is the most important decision. Top of the line is marinated kalbi, which is fatty beef rib stripped from the bone and soaked in a solution of soy and Asian pear, tenderizing the beef and imparting a slightly sweet and salty taste. For Texans and other barbecue purists, there's an unmarinated version available.", "Pork belly is a compulsory offering for any Korean barbecue joint, thick slices of unsmoked bacon that's mainly fat. Tragically, this cut cannot be cooked directly over the charcoal because it would burst into flame like an improvised explosive device and send diners scurrying from the restaurant. Accordingly, the belly is seared on a domed contraption placed over the grill that prevents it from absorbing much smoke. It's great anyway. The fourth and last choice is also piggy: fat-rimmed ribs that look like boneless pork chops, which cook up nice and smoky directly over the flame.", "Portions of kalbi are priced at $34.95, with the pork belly and pork ribs a few dollars less. The tables are set up for four or more diners (never go alone to a place like this), and one can easily order one less portion than the number of diners. It still sounds expensive, right? Wrong! With every allotment of barbecue comes a panoply of accompanying dishes, plus unlimited rice.", "Banchan, kimchi", "First to hit the table like a flock of birds settling on a field of grain are the banchan \u2013 small dishes served in bowls and on saucers. Those accustomed to eating in Korean restaurants offering four or five of these in a predictable vein will be astonished by Mapo's banchan. On a more recent visit in early spring, three friends and I received 13. Besides the obvious cabbage kimchee, shredded daikon pickle, and cucumber salad, we got sweetened shavings of dried squid, boiled eggs, and chiles in soy sauce, sweet potato noodles with slivers of vegetable, mushroom stems in a tart salty dressing, sweet thick swatches of tofu skin, and ripply cubes of something amusingly called devil's tongue jelly, dressed with scallions and sesame oil.", "Each dish was like a little adventure, though my fellow diners that evening didn't admire the potato puree that constituted a weak stab at American potato salad. These banchan serve a triple function throughout the meal: as appetizers, as side dishes, and as condiments with the grilled meat. By the way, when you run out of any of them \u2013 the long-aged cabbage kimchee is invariably gone by the middle of your repast \u2013 you should ask the waitress for more, and she readily complies.", "You can almost hear a drum roll as the barbecue accoutrements arrive \u2013 a guy dashes up to the table and stops abruptly, holding with tongs a blackened metal vessel glowing with lump charcoal. Everyone pulls back apprehensively as he thrusts the smudge pot into a depression in the middle of the table, shooting up sparks into the overhead hood. Another employee installs a stainless steel grill over the live charcoal. Next the waitress appears with your meat. She ostentatiously displays the well-marbled meat, then shows us the bones it was cut from, picked clean, to demonstrate we weren't being cheated. We hadn't mistrusted her for a moment.", "Multiple stages of cooking the marinated kalbi", "An important note: In general, you must order two portions of barbecue to be allowed to cook it at the table. Order one and they'll do it for you in the kitchen and deliver it already grilled. This could actually be good in summer if you don't want to sit on top of glowing coals. Even when you barbecue at the table, the waitress does most of the work, flopping the meat, snipping it with scissors into smaller chunks, then mounting the grill on an elevated rack and pushing the meat to the sides when it's perfectly done. At this point you serve yourself from the grill using chopsticks, or push the meat to the center if you want it done further or blackened to crispness. My advice: don't. The meat is tenderest when rare, and further grilling, while adding smokiness, can make the meat tough.", "The waitress shows us the bones, picked clean, to demonstrate we weren't being cheated.", "Chunks of beef or pork should be wrapped in the oak leaf lettuce provided. Smear on a little bean paste, and then add some of the marinated onions, or a clove of garlic. Indeed, some kimchee or one of the other banchan can be also included in the lettuce packet. If you get pork belly, you should dip it in a condiment of sesame oil, salt, and pepper that is provided before wrapping it in lettuce. Ultimately, there's so much meat in an order at Mapo, you may find yourself indulgently eating it with no accompaniments at all.", "", "A compelling free side: creamed corn", "In addition to meat and banchan, there are free side dishes, too, believe it or not. One is a sort of sizzling souffl\u00e9 in a stone crock, to be spooned up like pudding; another holds soon dubu, which is fresh tofu in a fiery stew; and, weirdest of all, a platter of creamed corn like you might find at a potluck church supper. You'll never go hungry at Mapo, but you may feel overwhelmed with all the details of what is essentially a prix fixe feast.", "But other dishes beckon from the menu, too. The mandoo gui dumplings ($14.95) are clearly homemade, and available either in soups or pan-fried (pick the latter). No vermicelli inside, but finely chopped greens and shredded pork. These are not part of the meal, but must be ordered separately. Other house specialties include the spicy red stews called jigaes; the seafood, tofu, or kimchee pancakes known as pajeon; steak tartare; and various noodle and seafood stir-fries. You don't really need these dishes, volume-wise, and it's nearly impossible to specify when they should arrive during your dinner. In general, they just mean a distraction from the rest of the voluminous meal.", "", "Icy cold mul naeng myun", "So skip them, with one exception besides the mandoo: The usual conclusion to a meal of Korean barbecue, which is all fire and smoke, is a cooling bowl of mul naeng myun ($17.95), either with or without broth. The fine-bore buckwheat noodles are pleasantly frigid and slippery, and the waitress snips them in the bowl with sliced beef, boiled egg, and Asian pear.

There was a downstairs to the restaurant outfitted with flat-screen TVs, booths edged in blue neon, and a disco soundtrack aimed at the Chinese club kids who frequented the place. Upstairs was a loft intended for their parents, crowded with round tables draped with white tablecloths, and decorated with waving babies and winking dragons.

Last autumn a new sign appeared that shouted Flaming Kitchen, a name that has engendered endless jokes among gay friends. The d\u00e9cor remained largely the same, but instead of music videos the screens now display news programming in Mandarin and, somewhat absurdly, American bowling tournaments. And instead of Shanghai, the menu concentrates on \"Szechuan Cuisine and Hot Pots.\" Yet when you flip it open, much of the Shanghai food remains, along with Sichuan cold dishes and hot pots, all-day dim sum, and Cantonese and Chinese-American stir fries, plus a smattering of northern Chinese, Taiwanese, and plain American fare, like french fries and chicken wings, all washed down with fruit shakes and bubble tea.

The server, who attends to this diner alone, stands four feet away, waiting for me to eat. The chef, who prepares my entire meal with no assistance, fans his charcoal behind the counter, wondering if I'm going to eat. The setting is the months-old reboot of Tori Shin, a stunner of a skewered meat spot in Midtown West. I can hear the din of the regular dining area, which is packed. But in this more exclusive area, curtained off like a first class airline cabin, I'm the sole guest. The bill of fare is a $140 tasting of chicken parts, surely the most expensive poultry omakase in New York, if not North America altogether. Chef Atsushi Kono has already fed me whole hearts from six pound birds, slices of loin as medium-rare as Minetta steak, and something called main artery, which looks like what would happen if Steven Seagal plunged his hands into the neck of a live rooster and ripped out its carotid, just because. All of these preparations are delicious. But now Atsushi has upped the ante. He places a skewer in front of me. \"Knee bone,\" he says. Am I really supposed to eat the bone? He smiles. \"You eat the bone.\"", "The skewer contains four ostensibly edible knobs. They have not been braised, liquefied, or pulverized, nor have they been boiled into a clear consomm\u00e9\u00a0or a milky tonkotsu. They are simply spheres of bone covered by a gumdrop's worthy of charred meat. Soft on the outside and hard on the inside, they are inverted Tootsie Roll lollipops for carnivores. I do not want to eat them.", "Chicken livers, main artery, hearts, tenderloins, thigh meat, meatballs, and oysters, presented in a box at the beginning of the $140 omakase meal.", "Knee gristle, as it's also known, is common enough at New York's cheaper yakitori-yas (grilled chicken joints). But it's somewhat unexpected when offered as part of pricier, multi-course meals like this one. Instead of caviar, we're serving kneecap tonight. Despite the city's ongoing craze for paleo broths and crispysardine skeletons, chicken bones haven't really earned a spot on hip Brooklyn menus alongside tripe, feet, and other in vogue off cuts.", "I start to gnaw on the ossiferous treat. The bone goes SNAP between my molars, shattering like a under-licked gobstopper. Japanese menus sometimes refer to this delicacy as \"soft\" knee bone, but rest assured, it is not soft. \"We like the crunch,\" the chef tells me. So do I. The bone has no flavor. It is pure texture. It is the adult equivalent of a child eating a plastic Happy Meal toy, minus all the digestive repercussions. It is one of the final frontiers in honoring an animal that unwillingly sacrificed itself for our enjoyment. It is, without question, one of the reasons why Tori Shin remains the city's best and most ambitious yakitori joint.", "Remains is the operative word because Tori Shin has been going at it since 2007, when Atsushi (along with owner  Shu Ikeda) set up shop on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It was a small poultry blip in a pre-crash New York overrun by pork belly, steakhouses, and pan-Asian stadium spots. I started visiting in 2012, not too long after Michelin awarded it a coveted star, and found that Tori Shin was unquestionably serving some of the city's finest (and most expensive) chicken tastings. Problem was, the cramped room felt as inviting as a dragon roll sushi shack. So in June, Atsushi relocated to West 53rd, transforming the ground floor of an apartment building into the more sedate fine dining establishment that Tori Shin always deserved to be, and giving this casual stretch of Hell's Kitchen, peppered with Korean and Japanese pubs, the high-end spot it has long needed.", "Here's the quick tour: A sake bar up front serves sochu-heavy cocktails under golden lights. A small corridor, which runs parallel to the $140 tasting room, leads to the 15-seat chef's counter. This is where you do most of your eating. A rectangle of a window overlooks a \"zen garden\" out back; consider it a verdant counterpoint to the gloriously greasy chicken, served in hues of brown, khaki, ochre, and tar. One exception to that color scheme, however, is the tenderloin, grilled to such a creamy white it could seek\u00a0camouflage\u00a0in clam chowder. Take a bite. The interior is as rare as barely-cooked tuna. The flavor is faintly chicken-y, while the texture is as silky as kobe beef. Then a whisper of fresh wasabi cleanses the palate.", "A chefs counter meal is cheaper than a meal in the private chicken room, but it's still not cheap. Option one is $65 for ten skewers. Option two is $70 for eight skewers plus small plates, one of which might be rice with scrambled eggs, a wintry end-of-meal preparation that's accompanied by chicken broth as rich as Thanksgiving gravy. Dessert is simple: mango or shiso sorbet. Option three is a la carte.", "Above: Starter course from the $140 omakase and the private tasting room; Below: Sake lees pickled salmon roe, homemade chicken pate with summer truffles, grilled nodoguro.", "For such an edgy (and expensive) little restaurant, it's impressive to see every seat filled at 10 pm on a weeknight, a sign that chicken, long the snoozer entree on many dinner menus, is continuing to have an \"it moment.\" That phenomenon is bolstered as much by our city's fried chicken and rotisserie renaissance as it is by our era of sky-high beef prices. An entry level tasting for two at Tori Shin, after all, will cost less than a large format tomahawk steak at American Cut. That New York can sustain such a restaurant is testament to our increasing tolerance for elevating foods that don't have a deep history of being elevated. Ten years ago, who would've thought there'd be an experimental Mexican spot like Empellon Cocina selling a $165 tasting? Who'd have guessed that Midtown would host a $200 tempura joint like Matsui.", "The prix fixe format, of course, isn't the traditional way to consume chicken skewers; the a la carte experience prevails both here and in Tokyo. Tori Shin is offering something different. The omakase experience is an excuse to sample parts of the chicken you otherwise wouldn't. It allows chefs to pace out the meal, serving each skewer one at a time (instead of all at once), just like a proper sushi maestro doles out nigiri piece-by-piece, a practice that ensures each morsel is consumed at the proper temperature, with nothing else on the plate to distract the palate. So while you might be tempted to order a la carte here, you shouldn't.", "Tori Shin sources its jidori-breed birds from an Amish farm in Pennsylvania and butchers the chickens in house.

Also known as the sot-l'y-laisse, the oysters are tender and succulent, covered by a layer of dense skin that rivals duck breast in its fattiness.", "Those who opt for the longer, $140 meal will enjoy a quieter, longer meal, with more skewers. The posh tasting might also involve small plates like yuba skin with salmon roe, greaseless eel tempura, coarse chicken pate with vegetable gelee, grilled iberico pork or wagyu beef, and what might be one of the city's most compelling noodle soups, a yuzu shio ramen that packs crystal clear flavors of citrus, salt, and concentrated chicken broth.

The porridge was mellow, the peas almost unspeakably sweet, and the whole thing mind-bogglingly good.", "The six starters swapped around as spring sped into summer. Now the peas are sadly gone, to be replaced in the porridge by curls of summer squash and a fried squash blossom, offering one of summer\u2019s best crunches. A cold soup of creamed red peppers soon became an even better soup of pureed sweet corn, with delicate fronds of fennel and a tracery of herb oil on top. The wood-burning oven often sees service where vegetables are concerned. Delicate charred asparagus debuted in late spring well-buttered and tossed with crabmeat; Faro is certainly not a place that fears dairy.", "One of the best apps, available throughout, has been fire-roasted beets with pistachio pesto resting on a bed of creamed goat cheese ($13).

While many of them evoke Italian models, they are unique things onto themselves. The squid ink calamarati ($17) sees the chef playing a little joke.

Black lamb curry is a good choice, a signature of Sri Lankan cooking made by over-toasting the masala, a powdered-spice mixture. Exceedingly rich and flavorsome, the dark gravy provides the perfect dip for torn pieces of flatbread. Another nice selection is ambul tiyal, a tart fish curry. The recipe involves lime juice, chiles, ginger, and other flavorings; as with sushi, it originated as a method of fish preservation.

The menu presents two further curry sections, and these can also be paired with any of the starches, or with a squat cylinder of white rice. One curry collection includes chicken cashew, beef and potato, and, less appealingly, chicken broccoli; another exclusively features seafood, reminding you that Sri Lanka is an island nation.", "Lamprais and San Rasa exterior.", "Also on the frankly bewildering bill of fare are various \"devilled\" proteins (stir-fries with peppers, onions, and ginger; some of the spiciest things on the menu and a bit sweet), biryanis in profusion, and a vegetarian section \u2014\u0080\u0094 though meatless options also inhabit the other pages.

There you'll find chili chicken, sweet-and-sour chicken, and, less predictably, fish chop suey on a bed of noodles. If your kids refuse to eat anything but chicken fingers, there's something for them, too.", "But if one dish defines the wonderland of Sri Lankan cooking, it would be the lamprais ($13-$14, depending on choice of meat). The word comes from the Dutch, reflecting a 17th-century colonial oppression, but the genius of the dish is particularly Sri Lankan: a farrago of familiar foodstuffs wrapped for easy transporting in a banana leaf, just the thing to carry on a picnic or for a long-day's labor on the tea plantation. Unfold the pillow-shaped package and discover a fried boiled egg, a heap of yellow rice, a sambal, a curry or two, a vegetable m\u00e9lange, and a fistful of cashews, which soak up all the other flavors.

A restaurant's adobe walls stand stark against the royal blue sky. Silvery cottonwoods shade crowded patios. Ristras, the wreaths of dried red chiles, hang near kitchen doors. Mountains bathe in a trick of light that turns them violet; they loom nobly through dining room windows. New Mexico is one of my favorite places, but on this visit it especially struck me how much the state's earthen beauty can enhance a meal.", "Santa Fe is, inescapably, a tourist town, and the restaurants tend to be polarizing: willfully scruffy, or expensive and precious (though a few manage to be all those things). These five restaurants\u2014a few standbys and a couple new entrants\u2014proved largely rewarding, and the glorious backdrop lessened even the occasional letdown.", "Huevos barbacoa", "Pasqual's, along with The Shed and Bobcat Bite (now Santa Fe Bite), is one of Santa Fe's most trafficked restaurants. Since Katharine Kagel opened her business (named for San Pasqual, patron saint of cooks and kitchens) in 1978, people have been spilling out of its swinging turquoise door during all hours. Pi\u00f1atas and strings of papel picado splatter color from the ceiling. Servers hustle out plates yet they don't hurry customers out of their seats. It may have the trappings of an old hippy enclave, but don't be fooled: At dinner a wedge of warm brie goes for $15.75 and an entree of scallops with orange-saffron butter costs $37.75. The restaurant sits a block from the city's picturesque plaza, and the atmosphere doesn't come cheap.", "Which is why breakfast is the time to come. The dishes intone the flavors of New Mexico and they're more affordable (though still pricier than the average breakfast). No one leaves hungry after ordering cross-cultural heaps like huevos barbacoa con chile d'arbol salsa\u2014long-simmered beef in a gently spicy broth with black beans, crumbly cotija cheese, and two eggs any style (go for poached with runny yolks). A bowl of griddled polenta sloshed with red chile sauce, chorizo, and eggs (scrambled work better here) radiates a more aggressive heat. This is a populist restaurant, so the food is not all flamed with chiles: cheese blintzes with strawberry jam and sour cream, corned beef hash, and whole wheat pancakes all satisfy. Lean toward the regional-inspired dishes, nonetheless.", "Lamb burrito with \"Christmas\"", "In Santa Fe, even the shopping malls are picturesque adobe. Case in point: the DeVargas Center on the east side, which houses one of several restaurants around town that have been run by the same Greek-New Mexican family for decades. Atrisco, named for a community in Albuquerque, opened in 2009. The simple interior's most striking feature is wooden slats, painted sky blue, set above the bar to create a pergola effect.", "Come here for an immersion course in straight-up, no-frills New Mexican cooking: blue corn enchiladas, tacos, green chile stew (often made with pork but here using beef), carne adovada (pork in red chile sauce), and of course a green chile cheeseburger. A burrito stuffed with roasted leg of lamb from Santa Fe's Talus Wind Ranch is a novelty I've never seen before. It comes with a choice of green or red chile sauces; request both, which in the local parlance is asking for \"Christmas.\" A plate of sustaining food cloaked half in a chunky sauce of fresh green chiles and half in smooth, almost rippling sauce made from dried red chiles epitomizes New Mexico. The fruity and dusky flavors merge and evolve as you eat; a swirl of melted cheese calms the chiles' bite.", "The AtrisCombo\u2014one chile relleno stuffed with green chile and a blue corn enchilada with red chile, sides of posole and pintos, and a beef taco in a crispy shell stringy with cheese\u2014will seem mighty familiar to fans of Tex-Mex. New Mexicans might be prickly about the comparison, but it is apt.", "Izanami exterior", "One of Izanami's line cooks and I struck up a conversation in the hot tub. For my dinner in an hour, he especially recommended the grilled chicken skewers wrapped in shiso leaves, the tonkatsu, and, for a splurge, the two ounces of grilled wagyu beef for $36. The setting for our chat wasn't unusual given where we were: Ten Thousand Waves, Santa Fe's famous Japanese spa nestled in the ponderosa forest just outside of town. Late last year, the spa fulfilled a longstanding wish among locals by opening a restaurant on the property. Now visitors can relax for two or three hours and then enjoy a meal yards away.", "Izanami is open daily from 11 a.m to 10 p.m., serving the same menu of small plates overseen by Kim M\u00fcller, a veteran chef whose previous stints include The Compound on tony Canyon Road in town. Even without a massage and a soak, the restaurant would unwind the senses. A waterfall trickles down jutting stones outside the door. The patio on the far end of the building looks out over the mountains. Paper lanterns emit a silky glow inside. The owners sent M\u00fcller to Japan to absorb its food culture, which she translates here faithfully. The flavors are grounded and direct: julienned carrot and burdock root flecked with black sesame seeds; hijiki, the frilly black seaweed, composed in a salad with edamame, English peas, and miso-tofu dressing; a traditional presentation of tonkatsu, panko-breaded pork cutlet, with cabbage and hot mustard and a squiggle of sweet, inky miso sauce. The cook was right about the chicken skewers. The grill's heat subdued the shiso leaf's assertive minty qualities and left the pieces of meat tender but slightly smoky.", "I bypassed the steak splurge for the gratifying burger gussied up with asadero cheese, caramelized onions, and bacon. Only desserts dabble in Americanization, including a small, moist cake crowned with slivered strawberries, or cheesecake perked with sweet-sour yuzu.", "Bone marrow", "Santa Fe may be a world onto itself, but it isn't immune to fluctuating trends: Italian trattorias, the latest iteration of Asian-fusion, and New American strivers come and go just like in any U.S. city. It's been a while since Santa Fe had a charming Gallic bistro, and Charles Dale, a native of France who has cooked locally for years, gives Bouche its creds. He opened the place in February 2013 to steady business. Locals and habitu\u00e9s likely appreciate the break from green chile overload.", "The kitchen delivers honest, sure-handed bistro cooking. A terrine layered with red peppers, spinach, zucchini, and yellow squash tastes clean and bright, particularly with forkfuls swiped through tomato vinaigrette. A crock of escargot exudes garlic, bone marrow is all textbook unctuousness, and sweetbreads flaunted an exterior crispness that gave way to creamy richness. Crowds huddle near a fireplace in the dining room on chilly nights and spread out on the handsome patio in the warm months. Frankly, it's an earnest place run by a skilled staff, but for visitors with a solid bistro close to home it doesn't need to be on their to-do list. My meal's most vivid moment came from the profiteroles, correct with a tender pastry and cold, quality vanilla ice cream and irresistible in the moment when the server poured over chocolate sauce in grand slow-mo food-porn fashion. That's a dessert worth scarfing down anywhere in the world.", "Sipping chocolate", "And speaking of theobroma cacao, this sweet adobe storefront in the center of town makes chocolate truffles and caramels, come-hither brownies and velvety ice creams. But the unique draw is its intense sipping chocolates infused with both Meso-American and European flavors. The former means potions like the Mayan, enriched with coconut sugar, chiles, Mexican vanilla, and enigmatic herbs and spices. From across the Atlantic, the Marie-Antoinette, a sweeter concoction with almond milk, orange blossom water, canella, and vanilla. Arrive earlier in the day lest the best variations sell out.

Chef Alex Crabb, who runs Asta with Parsigian, spent two months apprenticing at Noma before opening his own place and clearly absorbed some of the Danish aesthetics. He borrowed the silverware-drawer conceit from Relae, and both restaurants sport scruffy exposed brick and buffed concrete floors. But Crabb and Parsigian also threw in some American quirkiness for their spare, 41-seat room. Spray-painted birds and bunnies flit on the walls of the restroom hallway, and they left an image of Zeus, hoisting a lightening bolt, etched by previous occupants and uncovered during renovation.", "Mussels and potatoes; Monkfish with garlic scape; Duck and onions with beer-cheese sauce", "Crabb also worked at Boston's starry L'Espalier for five years, and his food is a rewarding sum of his experiences. He offers three tasting menus for dinner, each tailored to different appetites: a $45 three-course meal full of comforts like deviled eggs, braised lamb or duck confit, and coconut cream pie. The five-course $70 option veers more to the conceptual, a polished sequence of dishes fully in Crabb's repertoire, heavy on au courant vegetables. The eight-course $95 prix fixe is for the open minded, a chance to taste ideas in progress and notions, like beef heart with potatoes and whey, culled from the New Nordic lexicon. Obligingly, a group can order any combination of menus.", "Asta opened in January 2013, and Boston's critics lauded Crabb as one of the city's most promising new talents in recent years. After one of his five-course progressions, I can see why. His food has bravura but isn't uptight. The meal kicked off with mussels escabeche, set in a squid ink-stained broth as black as the mollusk's (absent) shells. Small potato spheres rolled around the bowl, with a few raw turnip orbs, identical to the spuds, tossed in to playfully booby-trap the palate.", "Parsigian is in good company on the floor with sommelier Paige Farrell, who connects Crabb's cooking with some strikingly compatible wines. For the mussels and potato dish, she poured a flinty Weingut Robert Weil Riesling. The pairings soon moved into French varietals. A fragrant, floral Domaine de Reuilly Pinot Gris Ros\u00e9 from the Loire fell in with the flavors of hard-seared monkfish made earthy from black sesame puree and a grilled garlic scape lassoed around the fish. A lemony Savagnin (not Sauvignon) Blanc from the Jura counterbalanced a handsome splay of duck confit with various fresh and cooked local onions alongside a pool of beer-cheese sauce: It was Strange Brew meets Now, Forager. A Pinot Noir from Burgundy's C\u00f4te Chalonnaise brought springtime strawberry notes to the breast and leg meat from D'Artagnan's Green Circle chicken.

Spanish restaurants have skyrocketed in diversity over the past decade, from Basque spots like Txikito and Huertas, to the Asturian-inspired Tertulia, to the pan-regional Toro, to the Moorish and Sephardic-tinged La Vara. But Portugal, a country of just 10 million, has\u00a0seen just a handful of chefs rise to upper echelons of Manhattan dining in the 21st century.

Now he finally has his sophomore venue. And it's awesome.", "Welcome to Lupulo in Midtown South, a no-reservations spot selling pimenton-laced mackerel spread and wood grilled sardines. It\u2019s rustic fare, mostly. And that\u2019s an important distinction. If Spain, as a country, is often touted as the future of food, with its foams, spheres, airs, and other modernist techniques, Portugal is perhaps more famous for its creations of yesteryear, like its caldo verde, a collard green soup traditionally served at weddings, or its its bacalhau, a salt cod whose underlying technique allowed explorers to preserve fish caught off the coast of Newfoundland as early as the 15th century.\u00a0Then there's Mendes, trained by the likes of Spain's Mart\u00edn Berasategui and, for a two week stint, by Adria &amp; Co. at El Bulli. He defied tradition when he opened Aldea, combining Portuguese sensibilities with his modernist techniques to create sardine napoleons and soups with alginate mushroom spheres.", "Shrimp porridge with head-on prawn.", "Aldea, even though it\u2019s toned down some of its cutting edge impulses, remains New York\u2019s fanciest Iberian restaurant, selling $30 entrees, $79 set menus, and $135 tastings. That's great for the future of Portuguese fare \u2014 the food is stunning \u2014 but that's not necessarily the most democratic way to introduce a skeptical city to an under-represented cuisine. We now have our cheaper, albeit equally ambitious Lupulo.", "For now, walk on in, sit at the U-shaped bar, and order a bowl of porridge. Mendes melts down a mess of day-old bread with raw egg, soffrito and shrimp head stock, imbuing the poor man\u2019s stew with the soft texture of good polenta and the lingering aromas of expensive shellfish ($16). Pair it with a tart apple cider and there\u2019s your $25 meal. Others will double up and order soft shrimp turnovers, essentially a high-end version of Totino's pizza rolls stuffed with creamy shellfish. Or triple down with the the grilled carabinero, a crimson crustacean so sweet and heady it can easily put a langoustine to shame.", "The setting for such humble riches is the ground floor of the Eventi Hotel, the same building that once housed Jeffrey Chodorow\u2019s failed FoodParc and\u00a0Blade Runner Basque restaurant (long story). Some seats at Lupulo overlook the polished kitchen, with its wood and charcoal grill; others afford a view of the second-floor male spa across the street, with its a visible sign advertising body scrubs. Oh, and just down the block is a check-cashing business. This slice of Sixth avenue, in other words, doesn\u2019t quite feel like the hip corner of Midtown that The Breslin, Marta, and The NoMad have carved out for themselves just a few blocks over. And that\u2019s okay, because Lupulo, with its bustling counter at 10 pm on a Monday, will help change those perceptions, spreading the culinary coolness further West toward the dreaded Penn Station district.

Don't miss The Mitten, an outstanding cider from Virtue Brewery in Fenville, Michigan. The over-ripe fruit, aged for three seasons in bourbon barrels, results in a super-concentrated apple flavor that's nonetheless dry on the palate ($8).", "Keep in mind that Lupulo\u2019s more rustic platings and preparations aren't at odds with Mendes\u2019 global outlook, or his desire to push the cuisine forward. Authenticity isn\u2019t so much a shackle as it is a springboard for the 42-year-old, Connecticut-born chef. So for now, there are no clams with chorizo, a classic surf and turf informed by the short distance between Portugal's inland regions and its Atlantic coastline. Instead, Lupulo serves a \"surf and earth\" \u2013 grilled asparagus christened with gobs of urchin from Chile (briny and slightly tan), and Hokkaido (fruitier, with a stronger orange hue). Gorgeous.", "Mendes tosses a warm salad of oniony ramps, earthy chanterelles, and snappy favas, which would be enough for some, but then he throws in a handful of morcela (blood sausage), whose luscious fats soften out any rough vegetal edges. The dish speaks as much to the chef's Portuguese heritage as it does to the contemporary style of dining where vegetables are seasoned with small bits of meat or fish, rather than the other way around. And while the salad, along with the asparagus and uni, wouldn't taste out of place at Aldea, it's plated casually enough to look more at home at a backyard pool party than at a fancy restaurant.", "Lupulo could easily double as a raw fish bar on par with the John Dory down the block. Mendes takes fluke, soft and neutral, and salts it up with fat beads of smoked trout roe. He cuts razor clams into fat, silky chunks, letting the meat show off its briny, metallic overtones amid slices of charred cucumber. He spikes red snapper with fermented chiles and kaffir lime, a hat tip to Portugal's role in the spice trade; he douses the fish in coconut milk, which softens the blow of the chiles, and whose white colors turns the entire dish into a maritime blanquette de veau.", "Charred organic young chicken with piri piri sauce.", "Meats are strong. Organic chicken, crisped over the embers and paired with a tart, spicy piri piri sauce, is notable as much for as deliciousness as its price: $14 for half a bird, a much needed break in a city where poultry, in recent years, has gone from the cheapest item on the menu to a large-format luxury. And 60-day dry aged ribeye is striated with intramuscular fat so silky that it yields to a gentle chew even when cooked rare.", "Charred young chicken is notable as much for its deliciousness as its price.", "But you don't go to Portugal for the steak. You go for the octopus. At Lupulo it's served as part of a rice dish that's as studied as Aldea's famed arroz de pato; the brothy creation packs a gentle scent of the sea and a wallop of cilantro. Even better is the $36 salt cod casserole for two. Imagine: a layer of black olive-topped potato slices hiding a parfait of caramelized onions, hard-cooked egg, and fish. The cod, reconstituted from a salty tomb, has been transformed from a flaky, neutral filet to a briny luxury that's as toothsome as dry-aged duck. Take home the leftovers, add hot sauce, and that's your brunch for tomorrow. One day we'll look back and swoon over this masterpiece the same way we now swoon over the prime rib hash at Keens.

That dichotomy plays to the dangerous narrative that cuisines from more developed countries are supposed to be expensive, while those from humbler regions are supposed to be cheap. Of course, the more open-minded way of looking at things is that Casa Enrique's accessible menu isn't any better or worse than the more creative offerings of Cosme or Empellon Cocina.

Amid the spate of glossy construction, his flagship remains defiantly scruffy \u2014 a converted house lined with dark siding and flanked by shack-like patios festive with Christmas lights. It stands in homage to the food stalls of Thailand that inspired Ricker's first restaurant (originally a take-out stand he began in 2005) and his subsequent empire. No other business along Division snares curbside crowds like this one.", "Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas may have been the first place in America to shine major attention on northern Thai specialties, with its grilled meats, shock of herbs, and spice-driven dishes so different from the color-by-number coconut curries that star on most Thai restaurant menus. Yet Ricker, with four restaurants in Portland and three in New York, has proven to be a careful translator with mass appeal. He's troweled and deconstructed recipes during two decades of travel to Thailand (and counting), and his replicas hit the hot spots of our modern palate. Ricker's signature charcoal-roasted hen \u2014 garlicky, stuffed with lemongrass, and served with sharp, puckery dipping sauces with ingredients like tamarind \u2014 opens a portal to fiercer, funkier pleasures such as chopped duck salad, the bird's liver offset by an uppercut of lime juice and fish sauce.", "Cha Ca \"La Vong\" at Pok Pok; Miang kham at Whisky Soda Lounge", "A recent weeknight scene at Pok Pok proved typical. I slid around the wall of waiting bodies to find my friend, who'd just put in her name for a table. Quoted time: 45 minutes. We crossed the street to Ricker's Whiskey Soda Lounge, which launched in 2009 as a valve release for the mounting pressures on Pok Pok. It soon developed its own personality, serving Thai pub snacks and cocktails potent and acidic enough to keep up with the spice and heat. It would be tempting to settle in for dinner at the bar, its back wall painted a shade of tropical turquoise that makes one long for a swim, and graze through the list of nearly 20 dishes.", "We ordered lightly to hold out for the main event. Pork riblets, cured in a rice and garlic paste and deep-fried fried, had an intriguing sourness that primed the taste buds. Miang kham made an ideal early-evening nibble: minced clusters of chiles, ginger, peanuts, dried shrimp, coconut, and lime were bound in a sauce that included palm sugar, tamarind, and shrimp paste and then placed on pepper betel leaves. Like so many of Ricker's recreations, it had more ingredients than the brain can easily absorb, but it tasted more harmonious with every bite. I sipped a cocktail made with mekhong, the Thai spirit largely distilled with sugar cane but also infused with rice for a sneaky aftertaste that recalls sake.", " ", "Chiang Mai sausage with herbs", "Pok Pok texted us exactly 44 minutes later, and we were soon sitting in a packed room with a compact bar and walls that morphed from red brick to wood paneling halfway up. Our server was tall and serious and took unusual pride in pacing out our meal so the plates never piled up. What struck me was the symphonic balance in every dish. Chiang Mai sausage, for example, soared with fluty lemongrass and galangal and boomed with fish sauce and chile while ground pork shoulder and belly took the melody. Fresh turmeric and cilantro gave it painterly color. Green chile dipping sauce and pork rinds echoed the flavors. It was cooking that doubled as tabletop performance.", "The finesse extended to the dishes that weren't strictly Thai. The restaurant's famous chicken wings were as narcotic as expected. Ricker's first employee, Ich \"Ike\" Truong, hailed from Vietnam. To the Pok Pok repertoire he contributed a snack of marinated wings fried and then tossed in a wok until set in amber of fish sauce, sugar, and chile paste. Bits of caramelized garlic were caught in the stickiness. And Ricker's take on Cha Ca La Vong, a catfish salad of sorts inspired by a restaurant in Hanoi that serves this one specialty, was a marvel of satisfactions. Golden hunks of fish (the hue in part stemming from oil tinted with turmeric) contrasted with herbs in turn bitter, earthy, and sweet; rice noodles underneath entertained the teeth.", "When discussing the food he studies and cooks, Ricker likes to refer to himself as a \"copycat.\" It's a commendable stance, the white guy not wanting to take credit for a cuisine whose layered complexities remain foreign to most of us. But if his influence keeps broadening our understanding of Southeast Asian cooking, and if his success helps Thai or Vietnamese natives who run restaurants in America find success preparing their regional specialties, then I'd say his imitation is more than flattery.

But in the 1960s, the area around 57th Street on Manhattan\u2019s West Side was a Haitian stronghold. The area was called Bois Verna, after a neighborhood in Port-Au-Prince known for its ancient latticed houses. New York\u2019s Bois Verna once boasted bookstores, churches, cafes, and bodegas called petit magasins. One of the only institutions remaining is Le Soleil (\"The Sun\"), a restaurant founded in the early 70s by Rolande Bisserth, cook and owner, on a busy stretch of 10th Avenue just north of 57th, where cabbies and limo drivers often double-parked to hurry in for carry-out.", "In 2011, a new landlord and rent increase forced the long-running institution to close.

The new premises is far more handsome and well-appointed than the previous one, with peach-colored walls above brown wainscoting, with the same collection of colorful tropical landscapes lining the walls, mainly in the celebrated Haitian Primitive style.", "The menu at the new place remains pretty much the same as the old one.

Not all the specials are available on the days promised, but on any given day you\u2019re likely to find a choice of 10 or so main courses from both parts of the menu, all displaying the same winning mix of French and African elements that characterizes Haitian fare.", "Each of these set meals starts with a simple salad of tomatoes, lettuce, and cucumbers served with French dressing \u2014 you know, the orange, gloppy salad condiment that comes in a bottle. There\u2019s nothing really French about it; how the dressing got to Haiti decades ago and was accepted as Gallic is anybody\u2019s guess.

These elongated fritters are made with mashed malanga (aka cocoyam, yautia, or dasheen), a gnarled tuber of the elephant ear plant often seen in Latin groceries. Mixing malanga with black-eyed peas and scallions, these crisp brown fritters develop a creamy gray interior and taste twice as good if you spoon on the hot sauce called piklis, which sits in a jar on the table. Formulated with vinegar, chopped cabbage, and scotch bonnet peppers, it packs a prodigious wallop.", "The national dish of Haiti is lambi, but many Haitian restaurants in Brooklyn no longer serve it due to spiraling costs. Here it remains king among entrees, though at $20 it\u2019s also the priciest. Known in English as conch, and Italian as scungilli, lambi is the horny creature pulled out of the pink-lipped shell that you hold up to your ear to hear the ocean. The thing takes a lot of tenderizing to be palatable, and Haitian cooks are experts at it. At Le Soleil the shellfish is fricasseed in a vinegary pink solution as beautiful as the shell. It\u2019s probably unlike anything you\u2019ve tasted before and a big raw onion ring rides on top.", "Other notable entrees include griot ($12), a confit of fatty pork chunks achieved by marinating the meat in sour orange and shallots, boiling them in the marinade until it evaporates, then frying the pork chunks until dark-colored and delicious. The same very French treatment is afforded goat (cabrit), beef (tasso de boeuf), and turkey (tasso dinde) with similar results. Pork is still the best, with turkey second. Love goat? On Wednesday and Sunday, it\u2019s available in an orangish brown gravy (cabrit en sauce, $14).", " ", "If you\u2019re really famished, go with the red snapper. Like the lambi, it will set you back $20 for a large specimen. The fish is fried head-on and whole, then strewn with onions. For lovers of plain seafood, it\u2019s spectacularly fresh. On the other hand, vegetable adorers will select a dish with the generic-sounding name of legumes ($12). It turns out to be the most African dish of all: a glorious moosh of leafy vegetables stewed with a few carrots and beans, flavored with chunks of beef. Pour on the piklis.", "Entrees come with rice and peas and a whole boiled plantain at lunch. At dinner you get fried plantains instead of boiled, and djon-djon rice colored an alarming shade of black, not in the Italian manner with squid ink but by boiling the grain with tiny, spindly black mushrooms native to Haiti called djon-djon. These impart color and subtle flavor, but the mushrooms themselves are removed after cooking because they\u2019re too damn tough to eat. The djon-djon rice also contains lima beans.", "Ultimately, the prime allure of Le Soleil may not be its French or West African elements, but the sheer size and generosity of its app and entrees, and the warmth of the welcome.

It's worth ordering whichever one fits your budget for the pleasure of whole presentation, which includes cumulus-light blini, slices of challah, and tidy rows of egg and minced chive. I can vouch for the $55 white sturgeon option, which I could have shoveled in by the tablespoonful. A selection of fish poses trout, mackerel, Chinook salmon in various smoked and cured guises; gently sweet pumpernickel bread on the platter helps subdue pungent cod liver pashtet (p\u00e2t\u00e9).

The optional \"fancy broth\" for the dumplings (a must) is made from simmering collagen-rich cuts of meat. It blended with a healthy dollop of smetana (a delicate sour cream) into a savory custard that enveloped the pelmeni while echoing their beefy brawn. The stroganoff achieved a similar harmony of meat and soured cream, and the use of beef tongue rescued the dish from its purgatory as a kitchen set piece on Mad Men. Chicken Kiev, another last-century American dinner party relic, made of a breaded cutlet folded around butter and fried, resembled a Nerf football in size and density. Its heaviness made me miss the light touch employed in the rest of the dishes.", "For dessert, I gladly returned to dumplings: vareniki, a Ukrainian specialty filled with cherries, pan-fried, and gilded with more smetana.

The bar and cafe occupied some rather louche real estate, a rickety, walk-up storefront on Houston just west of Bowery. Uruguayan-born chef Ignacio Mattos \u2014\u0080\u0094 who'd been unceremoniously canned from his previous gig at Isa, one year earlier \u2014\u0080\u0094 was now visible through Estela's kitchen door, enthusiastically making small, quirky dishes so intense one or two were enough. In fact, friends and I developed the habit of sneaking into the place around six in the evening, just before it got slammed. We'd sit at the bar and knock back a glass of wine and a vinegary mussels escabeche on toast, or a bright red beef tartare crunchy with sunchokes.", "So, if you're Mattos and partner Thomas Carter, what do you do for an encore three years down the road? The answer is, you let the pendulum swing in a more conservative direction, highlighting bankable rather than groundbreaking. Hence, Cafe Altro Paradiso, which partly functions as a surprisingly conventional Italian restaurant. Seating around 90, the U-shaped, high-ceilinged room sits behind a sliver of park at Spring and 6th Avenue, a non-neighborhood whose main commercial denizens are an outsize Trump hotel condominium and the modernistic new God's Love We Deliver.", "The room is handsome enough \u2014 chestnut-colored wood wainscoting with a creamy shade of white on the walls above, hung with gigantic tilted mirrors that reflect the room to infinity.

The room sports industrial light fixtures overhead that, when you've had a few glasses of wine and your head lolls back, make the place seem like a bus depot. As befits a depot, the noise level is deafening.", "My first meal was not inspiring. A few days after opening, the place was already mobbed, and a companion and I were seated at a bottleneck near the greeter's podium. It was like being in a small boat in rough seas, as we were jostled from every angle. What's more, a pair of short plates proved disappointing, more so since they seemed like Estela rejects: a puny octopus tentacle waving in a stubble of chickpeas and a beef carpaccio laid like a wrinkled hanky across a few slivers of potato chip. Modest in size, both dishes were priced at $18.", "But on subsequent visits, the better selections fell into place like a well-dealt hand of cards. And, with aid from chef de cuisine Aidan O'Neal, Mattos' genius was once again on display. The best starters cover the plate like an abstract canvas. A fluke crudo ($16) intersperses limpid swatches of raw fish and caper berries, irrigated with pungent olive oil; burrata flattened like a schnitzel plays tag with cured lemon rind and market greens; and a simple pork sausage poises like a blimp fallen from the skies next to a hedge of cooked greens.

Nevertheless, the coppa (a neck-meat salumi, $13) is so flavorful and nicely marbled, it shouldn't be missed. \"Is this made in-house?\" I asked the waiter one evening, expecting a \"yes\" as I dabbed the grease from my lips. \"No, it comes from Salumeria Biellese in Chelsea,\" was his forthright reply.", "The menu is divided into three categories: starters, pastas, and mains, so a classic Italian three-course progression seems on the agenda.

Four or five in number on a series of menus, the pastas ($19 to $27) are small for the price, making sharing difficult. Simply stuffed with scintillating ricotta, the half-moon ravioli are invariably a good choice. One evening they were sauced with verdant nettles, and on another occasion, stuffed instead with prosciutto, they shone in a broth with fresh favas.

Its contents change daily depending on what arrives in the restaurant's butchery department and market. Paula Foreman, who runs nearby Encore Farms, delivers variations on white beans (recently it was the speckled bird's-eye variety) in fifty-pound batches to Heartland's chef-owner Lenny Russo. In the dish's combination of animal proteins, Russo looks for balance: a sausage, a smoked addition, something with an especially lush texture. A form of pork is always present, but numerous cuts of lamb, goat, beef, elk, and rabbit also make it into rotation. Russo calls it \"the Noah's Ark of cassoulets.\"", "The approach strays from the traditional variants in France's Languedoc region, where the dish originated, but it was still the most satisfying version I've ever had in an American restaurant. The crust (panko flecked with parsley and glossed with duck fat) gave intermittent crackle to the sumptuous, motley ragout underneath.

He relocated Heartland a decade later to its current address \u2014 a vast space in St. Paul's Lowertown warehouse district shrewdly broken into fetching sections, including a dining room lined with brick and reclaimed woods, an expansive lounge area anchored by a bar underneath a floating red ceiling, and the Farm Direct Market that sells the same meats and vegetables the cooks use to prepare dinner.", "Russo goes the locavore distance: Around 90 percent of the food at Heartland comes from within a 300-mile radius. But there's nothing fussy or self-satisfied about the experience. In a nod to the forthcoming ballpark being built close to the restaurant, the substantial bar menu includes four burgers (beef, pork, veal, and bison) and fun, smart riffs on snacks like smoked kielbasa corndogs or cheese curds with apricot ketchup. In the main room, entrees dole out bear hugs of direct, honest flavors: rainbow trout over wild rice in green tomato broth, a rosy veal chop with braised kale and fingerling potatoes atop toasted pumpkin seed puree.

He did the season proud with a crisp-skinned rectangle of suckling pig adorned with a curvy sliver of grilled pear. Chestnut puree lent autumnal earthiness and honey echoed the pear's sweetness. Chestnut appeared again at dessert, flavoring a cake ball adrift in a canoe-shaped vessel with poached quince, candied pepitas, and dollops of sweetened parsnip puree. Then there was Flicker's luxury-loving side: loosely scrambled eggs gilded with pickled pig's feet morsels, truffle butter, and a stack of petals made from Parmigiano-Reggiano; rabbit tortellini in peppery nasturtium butter, dotted with hazelnuts and goat cheese. His all-in experimenter traits showed with a disc of orangey monkfish liver mousse. It formed the perimeter that held a quenelle of celeriac \"tartare,\" a silky wisp of cured Arctic char, and crisped salmon skin that resembled the rudder-like gnomon on a sundial.

It needs nothing else yet nonetheless benefits from sides of mustard-zinged potato salad; creamy, dill-laced tangles of cucumbers; and chunky lingonberry sauce. Among the dumplings and pastas, squiggly spaetzle rich with braised rabbit, mushrooms, and Gruyere is obvious and wonderful. Consider, too, the subtler spaghetti with crisp speck, scallions, poppy seeds, and plenty of pecorino. It warms in ways universal and enduring.", "As does the kavalierspitz, humble boiled beef goosed with marrow and a shower of horseradish, served with creamed spinach, root vegetables, and apple-horseradish sauce. It's comforting Sunday dinner any time of the week. If it sounds too heavy for lunch, try the generous cabbage and duck confit salad with punchy lingonberry-marjoram vinaigrette.

In fact, the most startling and memorable dishes I had at Heyday, where Christiansen is chef and co-owner, were pointedly cold. Chilled blue mussels came buried under a blizzard of frozen yogurt. A dessert called \"Fifty Shades of Hay\" went full-blast modernist. Hay ice cream acted as a neutral zone. Perched atop it: a meringue dyed black from hay ash.

Of course there are more overtly genial dishes \u2014 like a classic beef tartare or a playful dish of rabbit leg, ham, and sausage with carrots in various guises \u2014 but diners have embraced his experimental nature. It also helps that the staff tackles smart cocktails, craft beers, and offbeat wines with equal confidence. And that the space looks like a barn overrun by hipsters, with twinkly chandeliers among a hodgepodge of woods and wall-filling paintings of animals in wild primary colors. Hear the twelve-string guitar pounding overhead? It's likely The Replacements; one of the songs from their album Hootenanny inspired the restaurant's name.

Then face the hard decision: Order the four-course menu, customizable with five or so choices of broader Italian dishes within each category, or the set seven-course chef's tasting option that showcases Friulian specialties?", "I lean toward the latter for its novelty and intense flavors. A generous glug of creamy, peppery Venetian olive gilded the riso marinara, lush with minced shrimp, scallops, clams, oysters, and mussels. Lacy strands of chicken, slivers of matsutake mushrooms, and a molten tangle of leeks bolstered the earthy savor of blecs \u2014 wide, speckled buckwheat pasta. \"Maiale Invecchiato\" paired a dry-aged and roasted pork chop with mussetto, a potent Friulian pork sausage made with head meat, fat back, and skin.

The cook pulled a puffy lipped, handsomely misshapen sausage and broccoli pie from the tiled Stefano Ferrara oven shipped from Naples. Lovely. I was curious about Pizzeria Locale because the duo revealed late last year that they were\u00a0partnering with Chipotle on a fast-casual version of the concept, the first of which opened in Denver in May 2013. Of course it's expected that successful restaurateurs will eventually expand their reach, but I'd worried that the growing business ventures would ruffle the familial qualities that make Frasca so special.

It lies at the end of ancient spice routes, so the flavors are diverse, yet used with extreme subtlety. A pinch of powdered ginger my enliven a roast chicken; cinnamon is used as if it  were, quite literally, worth its weight in gold.

Not only is it the city's only Algerian restaurant that I know of, but it's also linked to Chez Omar, a 38-year-old French-Algerian cafe in Paris's 3rd arrondissement, which one American tourist referred to as \"culinary heaven.\" Near the corner of Grand and Bedford, with front windows flung open to late spring breezes, the deep and snaking interior effectively summons a classic French bistro.", "A wooden bar clad in brass is flanked with bentwood stools darkly stained, and used bricks dabbed here and there with paint pave the walls. Antique-looking mirrors hang throughout, giving Brooklyn boulevardiers discreet views of other tables. There is an interior room in which a stunning quietness prevails, where you may converse to your heart's content as you sip modestly priced wines. The Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 from Jas des Vignes ($31), fruity and dry, goes well with the tajines and couscouses that form the heart of the Maghreb menu; for the French flourishes like steak frites and assorted salades, pick the austere and lightly tannic C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne from Les Argenti\u00e8res ($31).", "Bar Omar.", "The menu is perhaps too brief, featuring both Algerian and French classics but containing more than one North African dish worth savoring. Brick au thon ($10) makes a very nice appetizer for two. Sheets of warka pastry,  similar to phyllo, come wrapped around tuna. Also cracked in the package is a raw egg. As the dish is cooked briefly on each side, the white coagulates while the yolk remains runny. Cut into the thing and yellow should spurt out, as it did on one occasion at Bar Omar, though not on another due to overcooking. No matter, it was tasty both times, like a Moorish tuna sandwich.", "The more familiar bastilla, another pastry made from warka, comes layered with chicken and topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar, making for a starter that also shouts, \"dessert!\" In Algeria, the meat would be pigeon (squab), a far darker and richer bird. No North African restaurant in town has had the chutzpah to serve the pastry with its authentic filling, maybe because New Yorkers actively hate pigeons. Aside from three rather mundane salads (including one featuring endive, walnuts, apples, and balsamic vinaigrette), we're pretty much at the end of your appetizer choices.", "Which is fine because the tajines are so damn good. These seem to be finished in the conical clay contraption from which the dish takes its name, which is nothing short of wonderful. Most North African restaurants in town simply dump the finished stew in the tajine as if it were merely a serving vessel. Does the charred clay add to the flavor? Not sure, but it certainly adds to the pleasure of eating. My favorite tajine ($36, for two) features eggs and kefta in what amounts to a Creole sauce, chunky with tomatoes and green peppers. That the meatballs are too big and beefy doesn't matter \u2014 call it an Italian-American adaptation of a Franco-Algerian standard.", "Above: Chicken bastilla and lamb tajine. Below: Merguez with couscous and signage.", "Made with chicken flavored with green olives and salt-preserved lemons, the most famous tajine is also rendered with aplomb at Bar Omar. A third features lamb and potatoes in a prune and apricot sauce. The couscouses are all generated from a single prototype ($15) featuring a very fine-grained semolina and rather dull multi-vegetable sauce to be dumped over it. The nine variations ($18 to $28) simply involve serving meat on the side, the same selection that populates the Meat and Fish section of the menu. Lamb m\u00e9choui turns out to be\u00a0just a tough roasted shank with little meat and no sauce. So go instead with the tender roast chicken. Or skip the couscous in favor of the tajine, unless you're a couscous fanatic.", "The desserts are exclusively French (with the exception of baklava), and generally good, and include a monster slice of tarte tatin served with whipped cream, and one of the richest cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es (my spell check wants to change that to \"braless\") you've ever tasted. Skip the chocolate mousse, which is so dense a chainsaw rather than a spoon is the proper utensil. So what does it all add up to?

Serpico takes the idea of Chang's now-ubiquitous pork belly buns and switches out the major players. He brines, sous-vides, and deep-fries duck legs and nestles the crackly morsels in hot dog-shaped potato rolls from Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, a beloved and longtime bread supplier out of Chambersburg, PA.

But nothing beats a soul-revving bowl of filigreed crab dyed turmeric-yellow from pepperoncini, the pickled capsicums that adorn salads in Italian-American restaurants all over Philly. It adds the right vinegary smack to offset the crab, the caper-brined trout filets, and the smoked potato salad that lines the bottom of the bowl.

It was a fine dining spot that would, along with Drew Nieporent's Montrachet, help establish downtown not just as a destination for fine dining but for fine living as well. Chanterelle's menus were handwritten (in English, no less) and there was no dress code, a stark contrast to jacket-and-tie joints like Lutece, La Caravelle, and La C\u00f4te Basque.

The link is a blend of scallops, lobster, shrimp, and bass mousse drenched in beurre blance. No, it doesn't have springy texture or head-turning clarity of flavor as April Bloomfield's better version at The Breslin, but it gets the job done. Pair that with a nimble $18 Alvarinho, a half-dozen fried or raw oysters (the latter are slightly over-sauced with a ginger mignonette), and you have yourself a light, civilized, and not terribly expensive meal.", "Will you have inspired food worthy of conversation in culinary circles at \u00c9lan? Maybe. Or maybe not. The menu is pocked with snoozers like under-seasoned vegetables with yogurt-feta flan, bland chicken breast in a saccharine corn miso broth, and ho-hum zucchini blossoms. But Waltuck, for the most part, dishes out serviceable fare at reasonable prices \u2014 no starters over $19 and no mains over $35. I'll take it.", "Restaurants of course are about more than just the food. They're gathering places for like-minded people, and occasionally those of a certain age. So here it's worth noting that \u00c9lan, like Nieporent's B\u00e2tard, attracts a more \"adult\" crowd that one might find at say Empellon Cocina or any other trendy East Village culinary establishment. Sound levels are unusually subdued. Cushy dining room seating is set aside for that increasingly rare policy that my seniors still like to abide by \u2014 making reservations. And the bar room for walk-ins boasts soft seats with lumbar support.", "The irony is that one will easily encounter New York restaurants that are both pricier yet less comfortable (and a heck of a lot noisier) than \u00c9lan. If Chanterelle was a bellwether in loosening the strictures of fine dining, Waltuck's new hangout is a reminder not to take that loosening too far, even at casual spots.", "Coarse terrine, an old-school favorite, is forever relevant here with its rustic flavors and gently cool temperature; so many restaurants over-chill their terrines. The potato potstickers, essentially a plate of large, potato-filled pierogis, justify their $18 price tag via a generous shaving of summer truffles.

General Tso's sweetbreads offer up overcooked organs and a diluted riff on the already average flavors of Chinese-American takeout.

Clam-dashi risotto with yuzu is firm and fragrant, but the mackerel on top is a dry, under-salted, sorry affair \u2014 and are we really garnishing good risotto with giant slabs of protein in 2014?.", "Fettucine with scallops, with no compelling sauce to tie the affair together, would have barely passed muster at an all-you-can-eat Vegas buffet.

Anomalously located at the corner of 113th and Lenox in lower Harlem, in an area otherwise devoid of Mexican restaurants, the fa\u00e7ade features Lola's visage beaming down, her hair permed tightly on top of her cranium. You'll take an instant liking to her, while wondering if she's any relation to the Lola in the Kinks song. Once inside, find well-spaced tables in a square room with walls painted a garish shade of orange. Limned with bas-reliefs of white gardenias, the straw-thatched stools and chairs seem to have come straight from a bar in a Mexican border town, circa 1960.

A hollowed-out lime peel bobs on the surface, blue flames licking upward. \"What's in the lime peel?\" I asked the waiter. \"Bacardi 151 proof,\" was his reply. He then suggested putting out the flames immediately and dumping the rest of the rum into the cocktail. Even without it the margaritas are stupefyingly strong, in flavors such as mango, pineapple, coconut, and a red currant indistinguishable from cherry Kool-Aid.", "Lola herself was born in the state of Puebla, Mexico, and passed away a decade ago, according to our waiter; obviously, her legend lives on. But as befits a restaurant in a border town, the menu runs from Mexican regional classics to Mexican-American fare from Texas, California, and the American Southwest. From Tucson comes the chimichanga ($10.99), a deep-fried burrito best filled with the shredded beef called machaca, a Southwestern staple. In shrunken form the chimichanga is also available on one of Lola's combination platters ($13), which also contains a taco and a quesadilla. But don't mistake this for Tex-Mex cooking, because no queso or chili gravy floods the plate, alas!", "[A flaming margarita]", "Rather have a burrito that hasn't been deep-fried?

You have your pick of 12 fillings. The strangest is dubbed burrito Poblano, reconfiguring the burrito as if it had been invented in southern Mexico rather than California.

Another specialty of the restaurant is carnitas in the style of the state of Michoac\u00e1n, fried pork tidbits that remain miraculously moist.

Ask for a bowl of pickled jalapenos, which does the trick nicely. The best deal may be the three overstuffed tacos you get for $8.

Hawaii, located in the middle of nowhere in the North Pacific, is 2,500 miles from the U.S. mainland. It's so far South it makes Alabama feel like a Yankee state. Its official motto is Ua Mau ke Ea o ka Aina i ka Pono, which I like to roughly translate as \"Amazon Prime shipping costs more here.\" And it's an indisputable fact that there are more daily nonstop flights from JFK to China than there are to Honolulu; a Brooklynite could even fly to Moscow more quickly. The state is, by its very nature, inaccessible, which perhaps explains why only a handful of New York establishments commit themselves to Hawaiian cuisine.", "It's therefore a boon to Big Apple diners that three young restaurateurs \u2013 chef Chung Chow, Gerald San Jose, and Jin Ahn \u2013 have opened the 56-seat Noreetuh in Manhattan's East Village, a promising work-in-progress that seeks to interpret the Global East (and beyond) through a distinctly American lens. If Hawaii's\u00a0melting pot cuisine has historically fused itself along the lines of its Polynesian, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Chinese residents, many of whom immigrated to the archipelago long before Uncle Sam annexed it at the turn of the 20th century, Noreetuh takes things even further, mixing in influences from France, New York, and elsewhere.", "Things stay fairly traditional with the poke, a seafood salad that typically comprises raw fish, soy sauce, sesame oil, and chiles. Noreetuh's version is a grade-A classic, mixing in bigeye tuna and Chinese spicy miso along with tosaka and oga seaweeds, plants whose gelatinous chew mimics the snap of beef tendon.", "[Top photo: tuna poke.

Noreetuh takes the smart step of omitting that industrial pork product and replacing it with something one might find at Katz's a few blocks away: corned beef tongue. The meat is supremely flavorful by itself, but Chung tosses on a layer of chimichurri-like  cilantro puree to brighten up the affair.", "You consume these\u00a0delicacies in a small, shouty room, while sitting on metal chairs or backless bar stools, and while listening to a soundtrack that ranges from mainstream (Lady Gaga, Hawaii's own Bruno Mars) to retro (lesser-known Notorious B.I.G. tracks). No cocktails at Noreetuh, just a smart list of beer, sake, wines, and something quite rare for an affordable, a la carte restaurant: beverage pairings. For $35 or more, Ahn, the general manager, will match your meal with three pours or thereabouts. Such a policy, at such a low price, should encourage more oenophilic novices to think of ordering wine as a conversation with a beverage director, rather than a random walk down an unfamiliar list.", "Prices are low all around, with mains topping out at $25; a stellar monkfish liver torchon is just $13. Chung divorces himself even further from his native Hawaii with that oceanic charcuterie. The flavor is vaguely saline, while the\u00a0texture is closer to an airy ile flottante than the foie gras it aspires to be. A dollop of passionfruit gelee and slices of Portuguese-style sweet bread nominally evoke the islands, but the sensibilities of this dish are more like a French chef's dream of the Pacific. It all recalls the kind of creative elegance one might've encountered in the early aughts back at Thomas Keller's Per Se, a fine dining establishment that once employed all three of Noreetuh's principals. And here it's worth noting that while Per Se's alumni populate a wonderfully heterogeneous group restaurants throughout the city (and the world), they've been particularly active on the Asian front in NYC, giving birth to such capable institutions as Uncle Boons, Mu Ramen, and Fung Tu.", "[Chef Chung Chow]", "Noreetuh, at about three months old, is an esteemed member of that group, albeit one whose kitchen is still finding its sea legs. Take the pork croquettes, which aim to be the Asian equivalent of salt cod fritters, a poor man's preparation wherein humble potatoes are used to extend more expensive bits of swine. Too bad there's little pork flavor \u2013 the meat itself, which you dip into a very run-of-the-mill barbecue sauce, is bland. The spicy gobi, a preparation that's about as incendiary and complex as a bowl of breakfast cereal, is a skip too. Kimchi-spiked octopus poke could pass for a mayonnaise-heavy seafood salad at any fine gourmet market. And white asparagus, with bits of Chinese ham, doesn't rise above the level of refinement one might encounter at Whole Foods.", "1.

Champagne, which often starts at $25 and over at fancier venues, is just $16 by the glass at Noreetuh (Charles Ellner, Epernay). It's what you drink with the (over-battered) mushroom tempura, or the tofu with uni and trout roe.", "3. Expect a solid variety of lean whites to pair with the delicately sweet, spicy fare. For something on the smoky side, consider the Francois Villard vignonier ($14). For a more floral wine with a hint of residual sugar, the Gunderloch kabinett riesling should get the job done; pair the latter with the jalapeno-spiked chow noodles.", "4. Though the wine list leans French, the beer selection allows for a taste of Asia and the Pacific. South Korea's Hite lager is easygoing enough to pair with much of the menu, as is the Big Wave Golden Ale from Kona, Hawaii. Both are $6.", "5. For those who choose to bring their own wines, corkage is affordable, at $15 for every 750ml bottle.", "Certain dishes could do with a bit of editing here and there. Does a cut of Wagyu sirloin, packing a hefty chew and a clean, concentrated beefiness, really need an assortment of cold, mealy, cherry tomatoes? Do toothsome chow noodles, paired with heady morels, and pickled\u00a0jalape\u00f1os, really need a week's worth of asparagus and pea tendrils in the same bowl?

This two-bite travesty costs $8, which is more than what you ought to ever pay for an entire banh mi, a single meatball, or a solitary slider.", "Vandal doesn't want its food to be bad. If it did it wouldn't have hired Santos, of Stanton Social as well as Beauty &amp; Essex, one of the least worst Tao Group restaurants. (The venue famously pours free sparkling rose in the ladies' room. Depending on your point of view, it's either generous or insidious.) Santos' food has always trended somewhat gimmicky, but during my meals at Beauty &amp; Essex when it opened half a decade ago, I remember a chef serving delicious, ambitious fare, from a solid lamb burger to a Wagyu carpaccio dusted with seaweed, amping up the umami of the beef.", "At Vandal, Santos smears beef tartare over a hot pretzel, resulting in hot mush. The menu is \"inspired by street fare from around the world,\" the restaurant's website asserts, a statement that raises the question of what precisely is \"street\" about a two-pound lobster scampi that costs $68.", "Inspiration, of course, doesn't mean replication. And there's nothing wrong with luxing up cheap eats. But the source has to be believable. And when it comes to elevating the price, the actual culinary art of refining such fare should play as much a role in the calculus as the tax on eating it in a chic, high-rent location. This gets to the heart of why Vandal doesn't quite work: The Tao Group sells a story about global street fare, but fails to deliver on that story.", "Take the fish tacos. Vandal takes an small amount of (expertly cooked) Chilean sea bass and overwhelms the delicate fish with a mess of slaw. Cost: $24 for three tacos. Consider the rice balls. Vandal calls the under-seasoned creations \"cacio e pepe arancini,\" and uses a side of parmesan dipping foam to command a $15 price. How about paella? It's not really street food, but that's the least of Vandal's problems. The dish contains no soccarat - the life-alteringly wonderful crust of rice that forms at the bottom and edges of the pan, packing in all sorts of complex flavors \u2014\u0080\u0094 instead, it's just mushy rice with chorizo and chicken.", "A modicum of credit is due for the adventurous spirit, though. Most sceney establishments pooh-pooh trendy fare in favor of tried-and-true classics, but Santos's kitchen embraces modern food culture, their menu riffing on the sort of thing Anthony Bourdain and crew will likely show off in their giant West Side food hall opening up next year. Sometimes it really works: Dishes like glutinous rice cakes or octopus huaraches are absolutely brilliant; the former act as a pleasant conduit for a spicy broth, while the latter is all soft cephalopod and pure corn bliss. Even the mini-ramen, a small bowl for $9, packs firm noodles and a wallop of smoky, bacon-laced dashi.", "But when dollar churros cost $16, it's hard not to be a little cynical, to wonder whether Santos and the Tao Group really think of Vandal as a restaurant, or as a forum to poke fun at modern gastronomy, a chance turn their guests into unwitting participants in a parody on what it means to eat out in 2016. Or maybe it's just a machine to make money. Whatever the intention, Vandal will continue to draw in the crowds.", "Ryan Sutton is Eater New York's chief restaurant critic.

Executive chef and co-owner Joshua Skenes didn't spend years working his way through fine dining strongholds. The 34 year-old attended the French Culinary Institute in New York and then worked briefly for Jean-Georges Vongerichten and with chef Anthony Ambrose in Boston before moving to California in 2005.", "Skenes and sommelier Mark Bright (both had been employed by chef-restaurateur Michael Mina) began Saison in 2009 as a Sunday-night-only pop-up in a former stable in the Mission neighborhood. At the time Skenes was also serving lunchtime sandwiches, soups, and salads from food cart he called Carte415. For Saison, Skenes and Bright started out offering a multi-course meal for $60, with $30 optional wine pairings. Even then there were glimmers of what Saison would become: Guests were greeted with a glass of bubbly. The kitchen was open and relaxed enough then that diners could occasionally mosey through. Stunningly prepared seafood and vegetables, still Skenes's primary palette, anchored the menus.", "The restaurant's evolution\u2014and its owners' ambitions\u2014went into warp speed. When word spread, reservations were often booked two months in advance. Skenes and Bright began serving three, four, and then five nights a week; within a year they leased the space and the pop-up became permanent. A hearth and a Molteni stove (essentially a cooktop Lamborghini) were installed. Last year the restaurant moved to an elegant 1800s building that once housed the California Electric Light Company in SoMa, near AT&amp;T Park. Its industrial starkness received some initial chilly reception, but a recent remodel that included hardwood flooring for the kitchen and carpeting in the dining area helped warm the space and boost its local star rating.", "At every step, Skenes's cooking intensified, the ingredients grew more rarified, and the prices escalated to match. Last year the restaurant offered a fixed-price menu for $298 per person in the 18-seat dining room, with a truncated $88 tasting menu in the bar. At the moment there is no bar menu, and in the dining room guests select from a $248 base option or the $398 \"discovery menu.\" The optional wine pairing? Also $248, though the staff will also suggest several by-the-glass options to carry the meal. Of course there is also Bright's wine list, so massive now at 3,300 bottles that there are separate tomes for whites and reds.", "I wanted to experience the full measure of the restaurant's powers, particularly to compare other tasting menus I tried on my trip to San Francisco, so I opted for the discovery prix fixe and the wine pairings. With one cocktail, tax, and tip, it was easily the most expensive meal of my life. I dined solo, and the bill came to $863.91.", "Caviar with smoked sturgeon belly and gelee", "The meal was also easily among the most remarkable of my life. After a tea of Meyer lemon and herbs, a hand towel, and a splash of Champagne, the first course arrived as an indulgent balm to banish the thoughts of money\u2014a glass goblet filled with a liberal tablespoon of white sturgeon caviar. It came over cured, smoked sturgeon belly and a gelee made of the fish's grilled bones. The smoked and grilled elements perfumed each spoonful of caviar without overwhelming it, and the flavors summarized the primordial themes in Skene's cooking: ocean, fire, distillation.", "Next came a riff on Proven\u00e7al barigoule, artichoke with scallop in a gently astringent, palate-priming bouillon steeped from wild thistle. Then, a succession of one or two bite seafood dishes that danced the line between raw and cooked: a square of Japanese butterfish, one edge quickly pressed against coals; bonito basically waved over heat and served with a dot of black vinegar made from the fish's head; an angular piece of pickled horse mackerel on thin toast with cr\u00e8me fraiche. Two marvels followed: roasted abalone in a sauce of its liver and capers, topped with threads of laver seaweed, and then one perfect lobe of uni lolling over a piece of toast from unrivaled local bread company Tartine, the bottom soaked in vegetable juice.", "How to define the food? You don't really. Like other brilliant, hell-bent American chefs of his generation, Skenes draws techniques from cooking traditions around the world and weaves them into a personal mosaic. With its nods to Asian and French cuisines boosted by those warm campfire overtones that our nation adores, I suppose the default label is Californian. Maybe we should just call it Skenesian.", "Speaking of which, Skenes had just returned from his honeymoon in Japan and wasn't in the restaurant when I dined there. But his team, led that night by executive sous chef (and Eater Young Gun) Mitch Lienhard, executed the dishes with clinical precision. The cooks occasionally stepped away from their stations to deliver dishes to the tables themselves, an unusual breach of the fine-dining fourth wall that I appreciated, particularly considering that the kitchen is on full display like a stage set.", "Grilled sea cucumber \"ribs\"", "As the meal progressed, the two-dozen dishes waxed and waned between the familiar and the curious. Smoked trout and an oyster swathed in Krug sabayon proceeded two sea cucumber dishes: Before the chicharron (made by drying the leathery skin and then frying it in oil until it puffed up), there were sea cucumber \"ribs\"\u2014interior muscles grilled and served in a frothy sauce of innards lightened with cured citrus peel. It went down much easier than it sounds, particularly because grilling firmed the sea cucumber's usually gelatinous texture.", "Celeriac with herbs; Halibut in yogurt sauce with plantain chip; Kumquat disc with rhubarb and sorrel granite", "A Gallic-inspired \"white asparagus royale\"\u2014a custard of stems under a foamy cloud, with grilled tips, smoked pine nuts, young pine shoots, and clementine\u2014was followed by halibut poached in seawater (a meditation on the fish's origins; very Skenesian) and then grilled with swarnadwipa, an Indonesian curry powder. The fish sat in a shallow pool of yogurt sauce tinged with coconut oil. In another creation, herbs and flowers from the restaurant's plot of land in Marin County cradled a gnarly hunk of celeriac \"crackling.\" It looked like an ogre in the Garden of Eden. Six Parker House rolls sweetened with brown butter appeared; I scarfed down three and had to push the rest away.", "Beverage pairings mirrored the food's Eastern-Western push-pull: There were four whites from France's Loire Valley among the wines but also sake and red rice ale from Japan with the early seafood preparations.", "The homestretch: a savory cookie showered with foie gras snow and stuffed with minced livers, and wood pigeon scented with coffee beans paired with paper-thin circles of pear dusted with red peppercorns and nutmeg.

Not the sweet perfumes of sizzling beef, chicken fat, fish sauce, cumin lamb, toasted cinnamon, or torn cilantro.

Dan dan, a classic pairing of\u00a0egg noodles, pork sausage, chile oil, and scallions, smacks of bitter hand soap. What's advertised as soft-shell crab bao buns turns out to be under-steamed sliders. And black pepper beef, a stomach-warming dish from China's Guangdong province, is a mess of overcooked ribeye in a KC Masterpiece-like sauce. The beef arrives in a stale \"bird's nest,\" packing the taste and texture of a paper doily. If you closed your eyes and successfully identified the Chinese names of all four dishes, I'd buy you dinner at Meadowood.", "Such ignominies beg the question: why does this restaurant exist? Buddakan, along with the Japanese-themed Morimoto, together Starr's first forays into New York dining, were born in a different era.

Starr's critically-acclaimed Buddakan was a hipper, younger, clubbier analogue to older, expensive, white tablecloth venues like Mr. Chow, Indochine, and Shun Lee Palace. And Morimoto, with a $200 tasting counter, was the larger, logical extension of the\u00a0Nobu 57 model, a sprawling den of aioli-slathered rock shrimp and $150 tastings that received three stars from the New York Times. There was enough room for everyone. Until there wasn't.", "The economy started to tank in 2007.

And diners, fueled by the knowledge of a burgeoning class of bloggers, food writers, and uber-locavores like Rene Redzepi and Dan Barber, started to value regional creativity and authenticity over generic extravagances.", "So why would New Yorkers go to a single watered down pan-Chinese restaurant when they could visit three tastier and cheaper regional spots? Because Buddakan is selling a good time in an adult playground. It's selling culinary dilution and safe exoticism, which is fine in the right places; the China pavilion at Epcot Center wouldn't do too much business if kids wearing Mickey Mouse hats had their faces go fully numb from Sichuan peppercorns. Most of the folks at Buddakan, after all, are better dressed for dancing than dealing with the effects of chile oil splattered on white shirts (spoiler: much everything here is splatter-free).

Can't he transfer it?\u00a0\"Bar is separate from the restaurant.\" You then order a few bites from the lounge while waiting for your companion, and the cocktail waitress brings another check (lounge must be separate too). Finally you have dinner, and by the end of the night you have three checks, three separate transactions, for a single meal, under a single roof. These people should get into the airline business.", "Char Siu pork, at its best when the exterior is crispy and caramelized, with a touch of sweetness, is simply a pile of under-rendered pork butt with sugary black bean sauce. Shrimp toasts are burnt. Spare ribs are cold. Broken chile chicken is as flavorless as anything out of the freezer section at your local Gristedes. Pork belly strips pack the desiccated texture of sun hardened shingles on a New Mexico home. Singapore king crab is passable if you can tolerate the salt levels; same goes for the fried black bass. Edamame dumplings are all about mush: a gluey wrapper and a leaden, sludgy, green interior. I could go on.", "Then the smell comes.

The tasting marked my first sampling of black winter truffles (over soft tofu), my first live sea urchin (with a neon-orange hue), my first freshwater clams (very mild), my first liquid nitrogen affair, and my first fugu encounter. The tone of the counter was reverent; diners were required to remove their shoes in the traditional Japanese zashiki-style. The cost was $200. It was, without question, one of the great meals of my life. And I'm sad to report that the space largely lay fallow during my recent meals at Morimoto, acting as a storage area for servingware.

This allows diners to contemplate each morsel individually, as the grains of warm, vinegared rice bring slices of barely cool fish to a single glorious temperature on the tongue. But during a chef's tasting at Morimoto's sushi bar, the nigiri course included five pieces served all at once, with cool rice and un-sauced fish. The result is average sushi, about on par with a chain spot like Blue Ribbon.", "During that prix fixe dinner, which also included a generic toro tartare, gorgeously unctuous seared madai, and an impossibly delicious salad of raw sockeye and shaved bottarga, I was seated next to someone who, instead of eating her dessert, texted on her iPhone while perusing fashion sites on her MacBook Pro for the better part of an hour.

Men might wear sunglasses indoors; ladies might don beauty pageant sashes (a hen party, for sure), and on certain unlucky nights, the men's room door might not close, leaving a row of urinals in full display for passers-by.

Three preparations contain foie gras; five contain toro and nine dishes boast Wagyu. Some will order that indulgent beef as part of a $22 tartare, a $24 over-salted carpaccio, or a $34 DIY barbecue dish, wherein guests sear the meat over a hot Mt. Fuji lava stone. By the time you try to warm up the final pieces, the rock is nearly cold, and the end product is gray and undercooked.

From the first twirled forkful, though, it's clear that Mark Ladner, Del Posto's executive chef, has transformed the classic dish from the inside out.

He blanches the lanky critters in broth with wine and aromatics, removes them in order to separate out the meat, and then chucks the shells back in the pot to reinforce the stock. Linguine, freshly pulled from boiling water, is tossed in this amped-up liquid, building an echo of briny sweetness between the pasta and the seafood. An emulsion of butter and olive oil varnishes the langoustine tail meat, which register as remarkably supple (but not at all mushy) against the al dente strands. The finishing accents of Calabrian chile flakes and Sorrento lemon from the Amalfi coast may be imported directly from Italy, but the scampi's righteous gusto and its melding with comforting noodles distinctly invoke the big-hearted spirit of Italian-American cooking.", "The effect is entirely by design. Del Posto is a restaurant whose name translates to of the place, and the sense of place in question spans continents. The kitchen treats the Italian-American lexicon as one of the great regional cuisines of Italy, presenting lobster Caesar salads and chicken alla scarpariello right alongside Livornese seafood stew and pastas in endlessly varying patterns and extrusions.", "No matter the dishes' origins, it's the molecular-level consideration that Ladner lavishes on their recipes that makes eating here, at the country's most opulent Italian tasting-menu restaurant, still a thrillingly relevant experience even eleven years after its opening.", "Burnt beef ribeye", "Of course, a mixing of true-minded and transformed Italian dishes fuels the playbook for many of the dozen-plus restaurants run by Del Posto's famed principals: Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich, and Lidia Bastianich. But here, at their most elegant and exorbitant venture, a broadly enticing formula is particularly vital. The 11,000-square foot dining space has scores of seats to fill, as well as ferocious, continually evolving competition from which to set itself apart.", "Del Posto opened at the end of 2005 as the pinnacle of Batali and Joe Bastianich's Manhattan restaurant empire, a sweeping, two-story statement in marble and mahogany that culminated the successes they'd had with raucous Babbo, Roman osteria Lupa (where Ladner, a partner in Del Posto, cooked previously), seafood tour de force Esca, and others. After swinging open Del Posto's doors, the pair would go on to expand to Las Vegas and, with Nancy Silverton, launch the wonderful Mozza restaurants in Los Angeles and eventually beyond.", "It feels like an ageless oasis, an elegant extrication from the always-rushed dailiness of life.", "Earlier this year Batali and Bastianich circled back to New York with the shiny, always-packed La Sirena in the Maritime Hotel a block away from Del Posto. The meal I had recently at La Sirena (barring Michael Laiskonis's exquisite desserts) had a detached quality \u2014 indifferently seasoned pastas, an under-dressed salad \u2014 that served to highlight how many better, bolder, more exhilarating Italian-American restaurants have opened in New York in the last decade.

They include fritters suffused with pecorino and black pepper \u2014 cacio e pepe, the dynamic flavor duo of the moment. One bite delivers the combination's umami jolt, and it's really all you need. The showstopper is a small teacup half-full of the most intense, concentrated chicken soup in the galaxy. Ladner and his crew spend three days and use 90 birds in succession, 30 at a time, producing this liquid. It arrives bobbing with a matzo ball-like dumpling made with corn flour, and a sip warms you like the blessings of a thousand grandmothers. It's a nod to the current popularity of Ashkenazi Jewish foods in America's restaurant culture, a testament to the universality of chicken soup, and an opening salvo announcing Ladner's mastery.", "Mark Ladner is a watchmaker who disassembled a Timex, and somehow rebuilt it into a Rolex.", "Astonishments like that soup also help justify the cost of admission. Dinner comes in two prix fixe formats: $149 for five courses in which diners choose each of their dishes (several options come with $10-$20 upcharges), or $179 for an eight-course tasting menu with choices already set, of which there is also a vegan version. The three-course lunch, formerly heralded as one of the city's great bargains at $29, has slid up to a still-reasonable $49. While individual prices are not listed, everything on the menu can also be ordered a la carte, an especially welcome possibility while sipping a barrel-aged Negroni or a Nebbiolo at the restaurant's sumptuous bar.", "However you choose to construct your meal, keep in mind that the pastas will serve as your meal's spiritual anchor, and the simpler the dish sounds, the more stunning it is likely to be. Someone at the table should opt for the agnolotti dal plin, a Del Posto favorite of fluted, rectangular ravioli stuffed with a smooth mix of pork, veal, and mortadella, the dumplings lolling in Parmigiano-Reggiano butter. Even dreamier are bauletti, larger bundles gushing sheep's milk ricotta and sauced in a brilliantly understated black truffle butter. (If you prefer your truffle flavoring more emphatic, start with the carne cruda, Ladner's aged-ribeye version of beef tartare.) I love that the sausage in the classic trio of ear-shaped orecchiette and broccoli rabe is made using lamb neck, an ingenious way to introduce more people to that velvety, under-appreciated cut of meat.", "Linguine alla scampi", "These highs soar so effortlessly that the restaurant's occasional misses have the same jarring effect as airplane turbulence. The sauce under veal alla Saltimbocca goes through a similarly slow fortifying process as the chicken soup and scampi broth \u2014 rich veal scraps and vegetables are added repeatedly to an ever-developing brodo, which is finished with Marsala \u2014 but the final effect is oddly flat and salty, with none of the wondrous nuance I'd hoped for. A gorgeously seared rib eye crowned with a charred onion salad came with a side of eggplant alla pizzaiola that turned out to be a tough, hardened puck. A tiny misstep, to be sure, but in this palace of perfectionism, such gaffes stick out.", "Del Posto has always differentiated itself through utter luxury; some of the splendor feels timeless.", "As do the occasional service blunders. There is the expected whirl of choreographed graciousness \u2014 smiles at the coat check and the host stand, chairs pulled out and plates placed in synchronized motions \u2014 though the seams may show when a staffer is asked to deviate from the script. At lunch, for example, my tablemate required a spoon. I caught the eye of a food runner, who, rather than asking what we might need, instead turned to our server (both were in a corner under the stairs) and wordlessly nudged him, pointing his forefinger at us. Awkward.", "Desserts allayed any modest slips. Brooks Headley, Del Posto's wunderkind pastry chef, left the restaurant last year to run his East Village smash hit Superiority Burger. Justine MacNeil, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Headley's (she was his sous chef), took over the sweets department and has winningly made it her own, serving desserts more soulful and rustic than her predecessor's.", "MacNeil\u2019s pastry kitchen has dispensed with unnecessary frippery, allowing seasonal fruits in particular to trumpet their purity. A panzerotto fritto, a fried hand pie, brimmed with a marmalade of quince, blood orange, and Meyer lemon in ideal, tart-sweet proportions. Red wine and yogurt played off one another in beguiling ways to accent a rhubarb crostata. Panna cotta, scented with a grappa that reminded me of Cognac, landed lightly at the end of a long lunch.", "Overkill is often the downfall of desserts in upscale restaurants, but MacNeil\u2019s handiworks beautifully mirror Ladner\u2019s pastas \u2014 directly, deeply satisfying, and deceptive in their technical prowess. That ultimately is the truest joy in dining here at Del Posto. Cerebral precision drives the cooking; what arrives in front of you, though, still conveys the emotive essence of Italian cuisine. Warm, flaky pie. Slippery noodles that yield to the teeth with just the right snap. Beyond the elegance and escapism, it\u2019s Ladner\u2019s exacting grasp of heart-and-mind pleasures that presages another decade of triumph for this remarkable restaurant.", "Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified Abruzzo as a city, not a region.", "Bill Addison is Eater's restaurant editor, roving the country in search of America's best restaurants.

We'd chosen the 1950s fine-dining survivor out of curiosity for the relevance of such haute French dishes: Were they timeless or anachronistic? Each of us had enjoyed the meal more than we expected, and at the end of dinner I asked, \"What's the modern New York equivalent of this place?\"", "\"Carbone,\" Sutton said immediately. Devotees of Torrisi Italian Specialties and Parm stampeded Carbone when it opened last March, frantic to bask in the midcentury red-sauce swankness reimagined by Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi, and Jeff Zalaznick. \"I'm suspicious that it's a fake,\" said Sietsema. \"The prospect of eating Italian-American food in a restaurant that costs threefold over, say, Bamonte's or Frost in Williamsburg doesn't appeal.\" Sutton countered: \"It's a refined version of the Italian-American food I grew up eating on Long Island. I dig it.\"", "Which is how we found ourselves recently together again, shouting to be heard while Dean Martin's voice bounced overhead and our slicked-haired server in a burgundy tux flamb\u00e9ed bananas Foster for a nearby party of ten. The trippy quality of Carbone's interior is a portal to Little Italy in a parallel, cinematic universe. A scene in The Godfather inspired the black-and-white patterned floor. The walls are the otherworldly blue of Mystique's skin in the X-Men movies. Film director Julian Schnabel's son, Vito, organized the art on the walls: Irreverent images of Michelangelo-like busts with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths, or pictures scrawled with aphorisms such as \"A black-out is nature's way of sparing me the embarrassment,\" are the only overt visual clues that an archetype is being toyed with.", "  ", "The tinkering in most cases is triumphant. What's particularly fun about Carbone is that it doesn't simply pay homage to the red-sauce palaces that simmered their way into popular culture fifty years ago. It also winks at midcentury Continental cuisine and explores the ways the two genres overlapped. Gigantic, pricy, nuanced versions of Italian-American standards populate the menu: baked clams, minestrone, lobster Fra Diavolo, veal Marsala. But a retro Palm Springs coolness informs the meal, too. Cocktail clich\u00e9s get chic makeovers. Chartreuse gives the rum daiquiri a femme-fatale edge; whiffs of rosemary turns a potent Gibson martini into a harbinger of the herb-rich dishes soon to fill the table.", "In his thick, Old-World baritone, the server confirms our order and then brings out pre-dinner snacks, including stalactites of Parmesan and logs of delightfully oily \"Grandma bread\" painted with thin, clingy tomato sauce and oregano. Much of the food substantiates Sutton's praise. Baked clams in three variations begin playfully (oreganata-style with fluffy, herbaceous bread crumbs) and then go luxe, with lardo subbing for bacon on the \"casino\" variation and the third riff topped with sweet uni. Rigatoni has an appealing slipperiness that verges on gluey\u2014a quirky quality that separates Italian-American pastas from the homeland. It comes in a tomato-vodka sauce with chile to magnify the subtle heat from the spirit. Mario Carbone crisscrosses Italian and Continental with his Ribeye Diana, a lofty spin on steak Diane in a jus that hints of cacciatore with pancetta, rosemary, and tomato paste. Warm, crisp-soft croutons complete a silky, piquant Caesar salad.", "  ", "A couple of misses threaten to disrupt the restaurant's silver screen dreaminess. We each disparage the plate-size veal parmesan\u2014the meat under a luxurious gloss of cheese and sauce is undeniably bland. Gemelli DiMaggio, named of course for the legendary baseball player, uses frilly west coast Dungeness crab (Joe DiMaggio hailed from San Francisco). At this time of year, though, East Coast blue crab is at its sweetness: Why not rename the dish and use it instead? The ending saves the show. The flames surge for our own bananas Foster, ginger icing nudges carrot cake into an exotic realm, and we sip limoncello and grappa brought to the table as part of the meal's conclusion. Two of us leave convinced, the third validated.", "I was prepared to be nonplussed by Carbone, if not actively hate it. I'd witnessed firsthand (from my vantage point at the sushi joint across the street) how the place had pirated the restaurant sign of the former tenant, Rocco, which had been a landmark on Thompson Street for almost a century. And Carbone's demeanor seemed actively snotty, at least from the accounts I'd read.", "But the restaurant's cramped and antique feel charmed me. The staff was freaky-retro, the place smelled of parmesan cheese, and a table of eight blondes sat next to us, flirting with their server and looking like they generally do have more fun.", "As a fan of Italian-American food, I expected Carbone's renditions to be standard\u2014and just offered in larger size servings, the way Il Mulino had done it for decades. Was I surprised! It was not really historical Italian-American fare, but that cuisine in collision with more modern notions of Italian food (from Italy itself) with modern American ideas. What Italian-American restaurant serves a Caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes and freshly made mozzarella? Carbone does it spectacularly.", "  ", "The tableside Caesar was great, but so many places make an outstanding rendition that Carbone's didn't stand out. I can still taste the vodka rigatoni, a daringly plebian dish for Carbone to attempt. Only the tough veal parm was awful. With what had gone before, it should have been remarkable. We knocked back a spicy Rosso Conero Riserva from the Marche, a region of Italy where some provinces have D.O.C.G. designation and from where it's possible to fine a great bottle in a store at $20. Ours rang in at over $100, but it was almost worth it.", "Carbone continues to be a place that I send out-of-towners. It's a quintessential New York restaurant you just can't find elsewhere (unless, alas, you're in Hong Kong, where the group has a second location). As I see it, every dollar an out-of-towner spends at Parm or Carbone or Torrisi is a dollar not thrown away on a tourist trap in Little Italy, at a crappy midtown steakhouse, or at Il Mulino.", "  ", "Carbone's cooking represents something most Americans are familiar with-the huge, saucy, melty portions of Italian-American cooking\u2014but at level of refinement, creativity, and technique that's more common for high-end French and Italian fare. This level of service and pampering is becoming relatively uncommon for an a la carte venue, though admittedly you still end up paying as much at Carbone as you do at a tasting menu restaurant: Dinner for three can easily exceed $500.", "\u00a0", "I don't buy the argument that Italian-American cuisine has to be cheap because it was born out of poverty\u2014really, most cuisines were born out of poverty. And I like to think a victory for Carbone is also a victory for Alex Stupak's ambitious Mexican establishments, and every other so-called \"ethnic food\" restaurant pigeonholed into the culinary bargain bin.", "But here's the thing: If a restaurant charges top dollar it has to render the best versions of these dishes. That was a damn fine steak Diane\u2014it didn't taste dry-aged, but it had a gorgeous sweetness. Is the $55 veal parm the best I've had? No, not even close\u2014though let the record state that I'm not a huge fan of chicken or veal parm in general. The flip side is that, during multiple separate visits to Carbone, I've encountered better veal Marsala than anywhere else -- and I've consumed my fair share of Marsala growing up on Long Island. Yes, the veal parm needs work.

Our deficiencies include Kenyan and Costa Rican, as well as Libyan. But one of our most signal failures lies in food of the former Burma, now known by its 13th-century name of Myanmar. Anthony Bourdain extolled it in the premiere episode of Parts Unknown, but all the city had until recently was a single Upper East Side old-timer, Caf\u00e9 Mingala \u2014 though 15 years ago we had many more.", "The cuisine includes wonderful salads featuring fermented tea leaves, pig skin, and pickled ginger; pork curries \u2014some sweet, some sour; squash, eggplant, and lentil fritters; plenty of eel and goat in preparations reminiscent of Indian curries and Chinese stir-fries; and noodles in all sorts of pleasing permutations. Which brings us to a Burmese newcomer: Rangoon NoodleLab, named after the British colonial pronunciation of what was once the capital of the country, more properly called Yangon. The city of five million is situated in a region of the same name in southwest Myanmar, on a river inlet that empties into the Andaman Sea.", "Rangoon NoodleLab started out late last year as a Friday night pop-up at 1080 Brew, a coffee bar on Wyckoff Avenue in Ridgewood, just over the Queens border from Bushwick. But late in April it moved to the Bodega, a wine and beer bar located a block north of the Jefferson stop on the L. Every Wednesday evening a menu of four noodle dishes ($9 to $12 each) and a dessert ($4) are presented, varying from week to week. The pop-up impresario, chef, and chief cook is Myo Moe, who was born in Myanmar. She uses a broad range of wheat, rice, and mung-bean noodles to create her sometimes surprising bill of fare.", "[Myo Moe]", "These noodles can take the form of stir-fries, soups, or cold summer salads, with some dishes toggling between those modalities. Individual recipes vary from week to week, so that one Wednesday if you order beef shan noodle \u2014attributed to a state in eastern Myanmar bordering China\u2014 it may be a heap of slippery and pungently oily rice linguine shot with beef nuggets, shredded omelet, crunchy peanuts, and cilantro, tasting powerfully of fish sauce and secondarily of tomato. Another week, the sauce might be thicker and more tomatoey, with a heap of ground beef almost like an Italian ragu. Either way, the noodles are memorably tasty.", "Another classic is chicken coconut noodle, which may remind you of khao soi, the coconut noodle soup usually attributed to Chiang Mai, a city that lies just south of Myanmar in Thailand. At Rangoon NoodleLab, it\u2019s a steaming heap of curried and stomach-comforting wheat noodles, enlivened by bits of pickled vegetable and crunchy rice cracker tidbits. But a couple of Wednesdays later, it had turned into a full-blown soup with plenty of broth heavily laced with thick coconut milk. The changes Moe weekly wreaks on her noodles provide a reason to visit her temporary establishment again and again.", "[Chicken coconut noodle]", "There\u2019s always a vegan selection, and it can be the week\u2019s best. One time it was a bowl of translucent mung-bean threads laved in hoisin that provided a spicy kick in the pants. On another occasion it was a broad wheat noodle in a dryish curry with carrots, planked with something called chickpea tofu, warm and creamy like egg custard. The bowl came with fresh mint leaves quivering on top and a wedge of lime that moistened the noodles and sent the flavor into orbit. It was the spiciest thing going on in Bushwick that evening.", "Wearing a blue apron with a shock of blond hair poking out from under her head scarf, the bespectacled Myo Moe works, not in a kitchen, but at a corner mise en place behind the bar at Bodega. Sometimes an assistant helps as she pivots between a tray of plastic-wrapped, parcooked noodles (usually three varieties per evening), and small bowls of spices, herbs, and chopped and pickled veggies. Most of her selections are prepared on a pair of hot plates in Teflon skillets, meaning if a table of four orders different things, the dishes must appear in waves. Sometimes there\u2019s a wait.", "[Beef shan noodles, coconut tapioca, and garlic pork noodles]", "\"Many of my recipes come from my mother,\" she told me one evening as I sat with some friends at the bar. \"But I like to change them a little every time I make them.\" Indeed, every dish I\u2019ve tried there has been interesting at the very least.

Sitting in the too-quiet room feels discomfiting, like watching a play in an empty theater, but the emptiness makes it easy to take in the space's cool, controlled beauty. Two canvases of colorless, textured scribbles echo the white brick walls on which they're mounted. Hardwoods zigzag across the floor in a herringbone pattern. Translucent fabric chandeliers cast a shivery mauve light. This place could be the great room in the home of a wealthy art dealer, or it might be a Bond villain's lair.", "Tonight, the front-of-house staff outnumber the guests. They are a serious crew, formal in their friendliness and uniformly reserved, whether delivering cocktails, discussing bottles of Riesling, or announcing artfully plated dishes like corn soup with lobster mousse, salmon with baked Gala apple, or yogurt sorbet with mint oil. Servers hurry these plates from the far end of the dining room, out of a kitchen so striking in its steely brightness that it looks medical in form and function. The master surgeon, German-born chef G\u00fcnter Seeger, bends over pans on the stove, his mop of curly brown-gray hair falling over his forehead while his cooks stand close, observing and assisting.", "Occasionally, Seeger moves to stand, unsmiling, at the edge of the kitchen, as he monitors the crew's every movement, the guests' every bite. He looks displeased to be feeding so few people. Never a schmoozer or a glad-hander, Seeger is a chef who is happiest when he's so consumed with the act of cooking that he can't spare a single moment for idleness. G\u00fcnter Seeger NY opened in May, though the chef is still struggling to connect with the Manhattan audience that he has been working toward serving for years. And his is a talent that deserves more of a crowd.", "Eating at his New York restaurant has unusual resonance for me. I've been eating Seeger's precise, elegant cuisine since the 1990s, when he ran his first eponymous restaurant in Atlanta, where I live. Most New Yorkers are just hearing of G\u00fcnter Seeger for the first time, but in Atlanta his name (which he spelled as \"Guenter\" back then) still commands respect in the culinary circles, even a decade after he left the city. Seeger arrived in Atlanta in 1985 to lead the kitchen at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, turning the hotel's restaurant into an accolade magnet. He was the first chef in the city to win a James Beard award, and he earned the Dining Room its five Mobil stars. He essentially put Atlanta on the national dining map. And long before \"farm-to-table\" was a tired platitude, twenty years ago he helped establish one of the city's most successful farmers markets.", "Sturgeon mousse with trout roe and purple potato chips", "Seeger stayed at the Ritz for nine star-making years, before venturing out on his own with Seeger's, a restaurant housed in a craftsman bungalow converted into a hushed, minimalist warren of dining rooms. Seeger's closed in 2007, after a decade in which the chef defined haute gastronomy for Atlanta, but also divided its dining community. Devotees rhapsodized over his studied, Old-World-meets-New-World creations \u2014 tomato gelee and sorbet with horseradish snow, foie gras bonbons covered in pecans, loup de mer with almond mousse.", "But Seeger also had a famously stern demeanor that came through in his work; detractors recoiled at the room's chilly austerity, the stiffness of the service, and the experience's lofty prices. I understood those objections, and sometimes cringed myself at the chef's rigid brand of hospitality, but I could never deny the brilliance of his meticulous approach to cooking, his obsession with clarity of flavor and his unexpected juxtapositions of ingredients.", "Seeger moved to New York after his Atlanta restaurant closed, and proceeded to consult for international grocery chains. In a 2011 interview with Atlanta magazine, he admitted to feeling that the Southern city where he made his name didn't have enough disciples of haute cuisine to support his uncompromising vision. He spoke of aiming for the day when he would cook in Manhattan, where he might be truly appreciated.", "Of course, during Seeger's nine years away from the professional stove the world of tasting-menu restaurants changed irrevocably in New York (and everywhere). Per Se slid. Modern tasting menu game-changers like Momofuku Ko, Semilla, and The Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare upset the old guard with casual counter seating in the dining room and high-low riffs from the kitchen that show off individuality and experimentation.", "Seeger's cooking has always been distinctive, but he also hews to a disappearing sense of luxury: sumptuous trappings, flavors that lean more to the sublime than the edgy. I can't imagine that changing. At sixty-seven years old, Seeger is not a Madonna-style reinventionist; he's more in the vein of Joni Mitchell\u00a0\u2014 a nonconformist. He has a history of remaining true to his lofty vision, no matter the praise or rebuffs that follow.", "Years ago, I had a couple of lonely meals at Seeger's Atlanta restaurant, dinners eaten while I was on food critic duty, when I would find myself among only a handful of other customers on a Tuesday night. So the quiet room I encounter during my first meal at G\u00fcnter Seeger NY feels awkward and tense, but also surprisingly familiar, almost nostalgic. I've been waiting almost a decade to eat Seeger's cooking again \u2014 and I find plenty in my meal that makes it worth the wait \u2014 though I didn't expect culinary history to repeat itself in quite this way. I'm guessing Seeger didn't, either.", "Chestnut soup (left); Gunter Seeger at work in his kitchen", "Seeger set a dauntingly high price for his New York debut. At first the nine-course tasting menus, booked ahead of time through restaurant-ticketing startup Tock, cost $185 per person with tip. Over the past five months, after some disappointing reviews (including two stars from Pete Wells in the New York Times), Seeger dropped the pre-paid tickets altogether and tinkered with the restaurant's format. Just in the past weeks, he's started serving $95 four-course menus, with choices for each course, as well as a ten-course set menu for $148.", "In September, a few weeks before the four-course option would become available, I experienced a ten-courser with a few friends. The meal began with cherry tomatoes from Campo Rosso Farms, a vendor at the Union Square Greenmarket who grows out in Berks County, Pennsylvania. The tomatoes arrive still on the vine, along with bowls of anchovy cream \u2014 a stripped-down interpretation of bagna cauda. I enjoy this as a kick-off snack, the fresh pop of the fruit against the briny twang of the fish. My friends shrug. It's a little too no-big-deal for them. I laugh to myself. One dish in and we're fully returned to Seeger's domain, the opinions around his food as polarized as ever.", "Here's the highlight over which we all rave: roasted black sea bass sidled up to a tuft of wilted Malabar spinach. Underneath is a sauce of pureed sea urchin and truffle juice. Cardamom-infused honey drizzled over the fish slowly runs into the sauce below; it teases out the sweetness of the urchin and equalizes the truffle's pheromone funk. Masterful. I love Seeger's linkage of choosing Malabar spinach, a green that proliferates in South India, in the same setup where he uses cardamom (which thrives in the same region) to such wizardly effect.", "The course that preceded the fish was one of Seeger's Atlanta staples: an egg custard, served in an egg shell barely cracked at its crown, flavored with maple cream and scattered with bottarga. In this context it slyly foreshadowed the sea bass dish's musings on sweet and oceanic flavors. But what comes after the sea bass shifts our course entirely. Rounds of beef tenderloin have been poached in a mixture of red wine, port wine, and Madeira; they come with a sauce made from the poaching liquid and some blanched haricots verts. \"This meat has no texture,\" one of my buddies grouses. \"It's a refined take on sauerbraten,\" I respond, referring to the Germanic pot roast. He pauses. \"Okay,\" he says. \"That helps me appreciate it.\"", "Not every course set itself up for such easy defense. Earlier, two oysters arrived nicely zinged with apple and ginger, but also topped with piquant whole chilies that obliterated any taste of the bivalve. And lobes of gently smoked Columbia River salmon paired with baked apple are cooked exactingly, but don't leave much of an impression. In this restaurant era of bold, global bombasts on the plate, subtlety can too often tip into dullness.", "The pattern of my first meal holds steady at a second, slightly longer meal at the chef's table, which sits perched on the very fringe of the kitchen, underneath an intricate iron chandelier fashioned by Seeger's grandfather. It's a Saturday, and the restaurant is full; the servers are more relaxed, having found their rhythms, and the room feels merrier. Again the German-inflected meat course \u2014 this time, venison scented with juniper berry alongside crisp-soft red cabbage \u2014 comes through as the dinner's spiritual center. There is smooth chestnut soup with shaved truffles, the essence of autumn, and a wonderful sturgeon mousse bolstered with trout roe and purple potato chips.", "Pastry chef Emily Hall's raspberry savarin", "Would that those spuds could have loaned texture to the utterly mushy beef tartare that came a few courses before. And a broth of matsutake tea with nasturtium leaf is meant, I know, to showcase the mushroom's delicate, slightly spicy earthiness, but the volume on the flavor is turned too low. It needs more overtness, more umami.", "In this meal, though, I'm also picking up understated allusions to the South in some of Seeger's cooking, echoes of his time in Atlanta \u2014 it's heartening that Seeger hasn't entirely eschewed the region that gave him his first flush of success. Okra relish brings vinegary bite to grilled abalone. For the featured cheese in the course that precedes dessert, Seeger often procures from two standout Georgia producers, Sweet Grass Dairy and Many Fold Farm. And the egg custard tart, tingly with nutmeg, is a sweet finale that Edna Lewis would have championed. (Seeger's pastry chef, Emily Hall, is a talent to watch: She also created a terrific raspberry Savarin, like a fruit-accented baba au rhum, that I relished. In an elegant visual move, Hall\u2019s desserts are served on plates decorated with a riot of florals, a subtle contrapunto to the minimalist plateware of Seeger's savory courses.)", "And now that he's in New York, sometimes the South comes to him. While I'm sitting at the chef's table, I watch a couple approach the chef. \"We flew up from Atlanta!\" the woman says, and then gestures to her companion: \"He's 50!\" The man chimes in: \"Well, we had our first fancy-dinner date together at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead.\" Seeger gives them a stilted nod and says quietly, \"Did you enjoy your meal?\" What I love about this exchange is that this couple knows who Seeger is, both as a chef and as a character, and obviously don't not expect any show of warmth or gregariousness from him. It is enough to eat his food and say a quick hello to their city's departed culinary hero.", "I hope New York will also come to recognize his strengths. The current four-course option on the menu seems right as an introduction, the right price and pace to home in on the German flavors, go for the gamy meats, indulge in some classic luxuries, and savor the comfortable chairs. G\u00fcnter Seeger NY is, without question, more Le Bernardin than Momofuku Ko.

Even bolder: Stupak's version of this meaty treat contains no flesh, just achiote-rubbed pineapple and a few slices of lardo. Inverse al pastor is the name, making it perhaps the first taco to take its cue from the formal language of logic. \"A basic formula for creativity is to change the proportions,\" says the 35-year-old, who speaks in the tone one might expect from a Yale chemistry professor lecturing to a crowd of three hundred. Stupak, in this case, is speaking to four people.", "\"Inverse\" al pastor taco with pineapple, cilantro, and lardo", "He walks over to the rotisserie, palms a tortilla, presses it against the pi\u00f1a, and slices off a few shards of fat and fruit. He drizzles each taco with Christmas-colored salsas and cilantro. He places it in front of you as if it were a warm piece of sushi at\u00a0Masa. And as you eat, you start to come to terms with the following: That the final savory course of an expensive tasting isn't a cumbersome protein meant to be cut with Laguiole knife but rather a fruit taco whose sauces are meant to dribble down your chin. That this Mexican-inspired affair is the only non-Japanese omakase where the primary utensils are your hands. That pineapple with lardo manages to be a more savory expression of what you've always imagined to al pastor to be. And that Stupak, the guy who hawks nachos on St. Marks Place and guac in the West Village, has earned a spot as one of New York's most exciting tasting menu chefs.", "When a high-tech chef rides into town to cook for a night or two \u2013 be it Grant Achatz, Jordan Kahn, or Albert Adria \u2013 Empellon Cocina is frequently where the action takes place, and with good reason: aside from Stupak, there aren't a whole lot of modernist-trained chefs running their own restaurants in the Big Apple.", "New York is indisputably one of the dining capitals of the world, but it's never really been a global destination for the type of experimental cuisine found in Barcelona (Tickets), Bray (The Fat Duck), or Chicago (Alinea). Our neo-classical city, with teems of bankers itching for protein-heavy client dinners, has a solid track record of sending avant-garde spots to the grave, from Varietal (mushroom desserts), to\u00a0Corton (sashimi-stuffed cotton candy), to Sam Mason's Tailor (bubble gum cocktails and spherical veal), to WD~50, the Michelin-starred purveyor of pizza pebbles, knotted foie gras, coconut egg whites, and carrot juice yolks that employed Stupak as pastry chef for four years.", "Perhaps the memories of a recession-era battering (along with rising labor costs) have prompted New York restaurateurs to channel more of their creative juices not into their cuisine but rather into their business models, with chefs toying around with no-tipping policies, lightly-staffed fast casual spots, and tiny stalls in epic food halls. Stupak's kitchen counter, accordingly, is not a separate restaurant, but rather four seats in the back of his East Village Cocina. Every spot is paid for in advance via the Tock ticketing system, at $95 for the 6 p.m. seating, and at $165 for the longer 8 p.m. seating. Translation: If no one shows up, the restaurant still makes money, and if no one books, Stupak still has a larger a la carte venue to run.", "Empellon is hedging its bets here, and in exchange the guest is rewarded with the city's most intimate tasting experience: Stupak cooks for you, serves you, hands over a shot of leche de tigre right after you sit down. The clean, cold consomm\u00e9 of halibut, lime, tomato, and soy shocks the palate into action. And shortly afterward your tongue is set ablaze by a poblano pepper jelly, a dangerous surprise hiding underneath a tame panna cotta. There's your reimagined, retextured rajas con crema. ", "Stupak issues a warning when things might get challenging. \"Everyone okay with grasshoppers?\" he asks, brandishing a chapulin-shaped serving piece filled with the namesake insect. They're not an uncommon ingredient in New York's Mexican restaurants, but at tasting menu venues, bugs are somewhat of a rarity. Stupak crushes them up with a mortar and pestle. \"They taste more like celery salt this way,\" he says, using the smashed remains to garnish a single bite of fried chicken wing. Delicious. But if you don't dig it, another course is minutes away, perhaps blood sopes anointed by heady boudin noir; both the corn cake and the sausage crumble in the mouth like a musky, offal-y brownie.", "Celery root with chile ash mayonnaise and coconut crema; Poached oyster with nixtamalized popcorn kernels", "The long tasting menu is key to creativity, a notion worth dwelling upon as the three Michelin-starred\u00a0Eleven Madison Park prepares to more or less\u00a0halve its course count and quicken the pace of dinner. Shorter menus typically breed more conservative preparations \u2013 a chef has less room for error because of a higher price per course.\u00a0Longer menus, by contrast, allow for more risk, as a dish that doesn't work is forgotten nine courses later. Stupak, to his credit, balances this gastronomic philosophy with the more pragmatic reality that people occasionally want more than a single bite of something. So instead of sending out a never-ending supply of wedding buffet-sized hors d'oeuvres, preparations grow and shrink throughout the meal, a little bit of palate teasing here, a hint of hunger sating there. A ten bite plate of celery root sashimi with coconut cream and chile ash mayo \u2013 an abstract study in black and white \u2013 is followed by a poached oyster topped with nixtamalized popcorn kernels \u2013 simple food that just tastes good.", "Stupak isn't afraid to juxtapose modernity with tradition, refinement with rusticity. He sends out crispy quesadillas with string cheese and pork belly and a near perfect salsa with each ingredient chosen by one of the four guests (an haute stone soup). It all tastes familiar. Here's what's less familiar: Super Bowl party-worthy masa waffles with chicken liver butter, or a tiny mousse-filled puff whose magnified flavors of dairy and corn feel like a gordita-esque hat tip to golgappe, the yogurt-filled Indian street snack. Then there's the classic Oaxacan black mole, which comes not as a chicken smothering sauce but as a star ingredient in its own right, an inky ice cream whose warming spice contradicts its cool temperature. A plate of prune sorbet with agar agar spiraled chocolate ganache appears soon after \u2013 followed by orange sorbet in gossamer gellan gum tuiles (edible cones as thin as Saran Wrap) \u2013 and you start to wonder whether you're back at WD~50. And you're okay with that, because you're here for creative, delicious food.", "Above: Trout flauta with trout roe; Below: Manchamantales with apple, pineapple, and sweet potato and tres leches with kabocha squash.", "\"I'm not interested in the cuisine being recognized as Mexican any longer,\" Stupak writes in an email. \"That's the genesis and consistent point of inspiration but I want to be free. All chefs and artists I admire are free. Was the cooking at El Bulli really Spanish by the end of it all?\" He is correct. And as New Yorkers increasingly fly to Mexico City to splurge on elegant tasting menus (or spend $125 per person at\u00a0Cosme in the Flatiron), they'll learn to dispense with the rosy eyed myths of authenticity and let Mexican food continue to do what cuisines hailing from countries with Michelin stars are allowed to do: evolve.

It reads:", "Where do these meals come from? I don't deserve them with my own virtue. Putting down all the desires on my mind. Regarding this medicine to keep our bodies. We get it to complete the task of enlightenment.", "At a glance, these phrases might come across as SoCal platitudes, postures affected by people who like their food clean and their protein shakes green. Buzzwords that reference mindfulness sell here in Los Angeles: The city has spawned a mini-chain of restaurants called Cafe Gratitude; juice bars refer to consuming their products as \"a ritual.\" But the words on Baroo's wall come out of a very different tradition.", "Baroo's chef and co-owner, Kwang Uh, is a native of South Korea; he culled the quote from an essay he wrote while studying at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Italy. The words are his version of a prayer he remembered from Buddhist ceremonial meals in Korea. He liked the intention behind the invocation, the reminder not to cling so tightly to ego, and wanted it to inform the vision for his restaurant. He conceived Baroo as a humble pursuit of these ideals \u2014 a small-scale, under-the-radar experiment, where he could hone his very individualistic style of cooking.", "Noorook", "The restaurant's short menu and mini-mall location belie the level of Uh's training; he has toured the planet in pursuit of cooking mastery. He graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park in 2009, spent time afterward at Daniel in New York and the Nobu outpost in the Bahamas, and staged at restaurants like Noma and Spain's Quique Dacosta. He moved to Los Angeles last year and immediately jumped into running 16-seat Baroo, along with Matthew Kim, a childhood friend. It's just the two of them, cooking and serving lunch five days a week and dinner every night but Monday. They prepare around seven plates, $9 to $15 apiece, mostly grain salads and pastas. From these basic formats, they build symphonic raptures.", "Take the dish Uh calls noorook. The name is a phonetic spelling for the Korean version of koji, the rice culture inoculated with the mold aspergillus oryzae that acts as a starter for things like miso, sake, and soy sauce. Uh blends the noorook with pureed roasted beets and cream, which he adds to a mix of pleasantly chewy grains \u2014\u00a0Job's tears, kamut, and farro \u2014 and then surrounds with a dizzying number of other ingredients: seaweed dashi, toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds, macadamia nuts, finger lime segments, and a few wisps of onion pickled with rose.", "Basically, the dish is a mic drop on the done-to-death beet salad you'll find in nearly every restaurant these days. The koji is earthy sweet \u2014 almost mulchy, in the best possible sense. Everything else on the plate orbits around its glossy goodness, pinging sweet, citrusy, floral, and umami tastes that vary with every forkful. I felt not just sated after finishing it, but nourished.", "As the koji (and those jars in the back) might hint, Uh has a thing for fermentation. Some fermented element makes a star showing on nearly every plate. Fried rice shimmers from the addition of a gentle, dulcet pineapple kimchi. Powdered sauerkraut gives an extra level of zing to a lush oxtail ragout clinging to homemade pasta. The drink of choice is homemade kombucha, served in flavors like elderberry or yuzu with lemon verbena.", "  ", "The fermentation wall at Baroo", "There is an utter individualism to Uh's approach to the food he serves; I would go as far to say it's the only restaurant of its kind in America. Uh and Kim didn't expect Baroo to draw much attention, but the sheer vibrance of the food has mesmerized LA's dining critics and obsessives. Since opening last August, the restaurant has been labeled an \"avant-garde Korean fermentation health food restaurant,\" \"a taste of the future,\" and the place that is \"taking up the mantle of California cuisine.\" I think those descriptions are true. But there's also something deeper about the restaurant that struck me personally \u2014 something I've never sensed in quite the same way during my 14 years of writing about dining in America. Baroo comes across as an exercise in Buddhist practice.", "\"Baroo\" is part of a longer Korean word, phonetically spelled baroo-gong-yang, which refers to the traditional Buddhist temple meals in Korea that includes a host of small vegetarian dishes, many enlivened with kimchi and other fermented foods; \"baroo\" refers specifically to the name of the bowl out of which monks eat their meals.", "In my twenties, I was a serious student of Zen. I was kicking around the country in the mid-1990s, a little lost but not freaking out too much over it, cooking in restaurants to support myself and in my spare time meditating and teaching myself to write. These dual interests had been kindled when a friend had given me a book, Writing Down The Bones, by writer, teacher, and Zen practitioner Natalie Goldberg.", "A foundation of Zen is the sesshin, or meditation practice period. It can last a half-day, seven days, or longer. It includes zazen (sitting meditation), kinhin (walking meditation), simple meals, and work practice. If this sounds relaxing, trust me when I say it is not. I sat a seven-day sesshin in Minneapolis once. Each day began before dawn and lasted well into the night. Adhering to the repetition and structure of the practice is one of the hardest things I've ever done. My body ached; my mind revolted a thousand times a day. At the end of the week, I felt like fistfuls of live wires had been pulled out of me and left in the open to sizzle. At the same time I felt exceptionally still and present \u2014 more so, honestly, than I've probably been before or since.", "Gim", "My second meal at Baroo transported me back to that feeling. I'd shown up for dinner, right as the restaurant opened on a Sunday evening. While Matthew Kim took my order at the counter, I could see Kwang Uh's straight back in the kitchen by the stove. His motions were certain, deliberate. He hustled but he stayed composed. Kim occasionally stepped into the kitchen to help, but Uh did most of the cooking alone. While waiting for my friends to arrive, I stood off to the side and watched him compose his bibim salad, a riff on Korean bibimbap. He covered a mix of quinoa, oats, and bulgur in a dressing of tomato and gochujang (fermented chile paste), drizzled an herb coulis around the plate, and buried the grains in an artful pile of shaved fennel, celery, radish, and other vegetables. And then he went on to the next task.", "Obviously, that's the job of a cook: repetition, focus, consistency. But I've watched hundreds of chefs at work over the years, and Uh was the only one whose calm and steadiness made me think: This reminds me of practicing in that sesshin.", "The head cook in a Zen monastery is called the tenzo. Tassajara Dinners &amp; Desserts, a cookbook inspired by the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center near Big Sur, cites instructions for the tenzo laid out by Dogen, a thirteenth century monk who is one of Zen's great teachers: \"When steaming rice, regard the pot as your own head; when washing rice, know that the water is your own life.\" That quality of mindful presence comes through so clearly in Uh's cooking. In my time, I've dined at a lot of restaurants run by various spiritual organizations, and rarely has the food come across as this alive and this delicious.", "I asked Uh in an email if he considers himself a Buddhist. \"I might say half joking and half real that a two-staff operation is a great practice in lowering ego and connecting self to the Universe,\" he replied. \"If I have to say my religion, I can say I'm Buddhist, but really I'm the sort of person who respects aspects of every valid religion. Most of the Buddhists I know don't take Buddhism as religion but rather as a sort of life guide. That's why I'm into it.\"", "Mindfulness doesn't mean perfection is guaranteed. I'd suggest going to Baroo on a weekday if possible, at the beginning or end of a shift, to appreciate the restaurant at its calmest. Uh stays composed in the maelstrom, but at its busiest the one-man kitchen can lag, and the wait times can be frustrating to customers. Food comes out in sputters and Uh might run out of garnishes \u2014 say, the blue potato chips that add frisky crunch to the pineapple kimchi fried rice.", "  ", "Baroo's Ragu Style", "That is the challenge of opening a restaurant as an experiment, rather than a well-staffed operation. Uh and Kim didn't at all anticipate their popularity or impact. It's one thing to craft a very personal expression of food with love and spiritual intention. It's another to churn out plates for hungry customers. For a while Uh seemed determined to keep the operation as only him and Kim. Recently he mentioned that he's likely going to hire at least one additional pair of hands to help out.", "Despite its quirky nature, Baroo's success is hardly surprising. It speaks to so many of the zeitgeit's favorite culinary topics: vegetable-forward cooking, an interest in Korean flavors, the endless appeal of comfort food, the fascination with fermentation. Uh has managed to combine these things organically, into a holistic, ornate style that's all his own. Los Angeles is fertile ground right now for similarly tiny restaurants run by accomplished chefs who want to cook from the heart without enormous overhead. Jessica Koslow started a national breakfast sensation at Sqirl, whose seating comprised 10 stools around a counter when it opened in 2013. Former Patina chef Charles Olalia now crafts rice bowls inspired by his Filipino heritage at the seven-seat Rice Bar downtown. Miniscule restaurant Dune, in Atwater Village, redefines the modest falafel sandwich with its exquisite, richly textured interpretation.", "Baroo is the most fascinatingly unconventional of them all. The spiritual inquisitiveness that comes through in Uh's approach differentiates it from restaurants that nail the trends but don't embody his unique search for connection. Baroo is a cutting-edge model for a restaurant \u2014 modest and ambitious and punishing, and centered around an ethos rather than a specific cuisine. Certainly its very existence, with the spotlight on fermentation and in the extreme dedication of its owners, is a testament to the art of transformation.", "Perhaps it\u2019s also untenable. The experiment might end at some point. Uh has hinted that he might close the restaurant after its one-year anniversary this summer and move on to something else. Given his resume, he seems prone to wandering. I\u2019m hoping Baroo\u2019s success might convince Uh to stay put in Los Angeles for a while. But who knows? One of Buddhism\u2019s most famous truisms is that the origin of suffering is attachment. That\u2019s why the subject of food shows up so regularly in Buddhist teachings: Eating is a daily lesson in impermanence. Like monks performing ikebana, the Zen art of arranging flowers with the awareness that they will wither away, chefs start from scratch, building beautiful plates, and we demolish them.", "5706 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, (323) 819-4344, baroola.strikingly.com", " ", "Header photo by Bill Addison.

The food is reasonably priced and of surprisingly high quality. Whether the star attraction is sublime pizza or a sustaining noodle bowl or a brilliantly engineered sandwich, the dish mesmerizes with its craftsmanship and expressiveness. Beyond the accomplished service and remarkable food, these restaurants possess an ineffable sense of community and place. They reflect their city or town or rural stretch of highway more profoundly than just about any other restaurant could. Really, coming upon modest places that accomplish all this is as rare as finding a genuinely stunning high-end indulgence.", " ", "One of the finest examples of this type of restaurant is Seattle's tiny Il Corvo. Owner Mike Easton crafts three daily-changing pastas as the centerpiece of his menu, which he serves only for lunch on Monday through Friday. No dinner; no weekends. Service begins at 11 a.m., and by noon a ragged, cheerful line reaches back to the door of the 36-seat space.", " ", "When I ate there on a mild October day last year, the veneer of pesto on a slinky twirl of tagliarini radiated mint, and the sauce's herbal harmonics (there was also basil and parsley) resounded clear and bright on the palate. Swirly fusilli came tossed with crisp wisps of house-made pancetta, slivers of red cabbage and soft braised fennel. More recently, Easton paired the complex torchietti, a pasta made with curvy, ridged twists of dough, with simple, reassuring walnut and spring onion cream sauce. The menu's only near-constant dish is pappardelle alla Bolognese. The coil of wide noodles, slicked with meaty gravy and finished with a generous grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano, is served year-round, even on warm August days. Easton knows that some comforts transcend the seasons.", "Pappardelle alla Bolognese at Il Corvo.", "Here's the kicker: Easton charges a mere $9 for these pastas. In a way the price is sensible: The Italian staple may be labor-intensive but the ingredients are inexpensive. Handmade pasta consists of just flour and eggs or flour and water, after all. But I can't think of another instance in my 15-year career as a critic where I've encountered such astounding pasta for under $10. The remaining roster of dishes listed on the restaurant's chalkboard usually includes a handful of rotating, affordable antipasti: perhaps prosciutto scattered with diced pickled celery, or a bowl of mixed olives, or a salad built around kale or chickpeas. But for both flavor and price, the pastas are the undeniable scene-stealers.", " ", "Easton's mastery and affordability have propelled Il Corvo to local cult status. He deserves it. This is the kind of animated, community-minded restaurant I wish for every neighborhood in America. That said, I've visited a great deal of neighborhoods in the past few years, and I've never come across any place quite like it.", "Il Corvo began in the same way as a number of new independent projects by chefs: as a permanent pop-up. In 2011 Easton was working as executive chef at Seattle's Lecosho, a restaurant where entrees like New York strip with braised kale, fingerling potatoes, and chanterelle-leek ragu goes for $33. Easton longed to spend more time with his young family, and after a trip to Italy he'd begun geeking out on pasta-making. He obsessed over the recipe proportions and started acquiring the antique rollers, spindles and extruders used to shape the dough into endless forms.", " ", "His friend Brian Garrity owned Procopio Gelateria in Pike Place Market; Easton had actually pulled espresso and scooped frozen treats there in 1999 when he first moved to Seattle. After leaving Lecosho, Easton approached Garrity about renting space in the gelateria for his pasta experiment.", " ", "From the start, Easton's plan was to serve only lunch. \"I was crafting more of a lifestyle than a restaurant,\" he said by phone. \"I don't mind getting up early.

But his masterful pastas became a sensation with local critics and diners, enabling Il Corvo to open in their current space on a steep hill in the Pioneer Square area in January 2013.", "The exterior of Il Corvo.", "These days Easton and his crew crank out 250 to 300 portions of pasta every shift. And they're slowly building what might be the country's most humble restaurant empire. Il Corvo's success enabled Easton and longtime employee Johannes Heitzeberg to open a second restaurant, Pizzeria Gabbiano, in late 2014. The concept specializes in thin, Roman-style focaccia topped with combinations like capicola, caramelized onions, and fennel fronds. Like Il Corvo, Gabbiano is also open solely for weekday lunch, and a meal there is efficient and uplifting: We put it on Eater's inaugural Best New Restaurants list last year.", " ", "Easton is also gearing up to retail his pastas, since customers at Il Corvo have been asking about buying noodles for years.

Easton is still there around 6 a.m. every morning, gauging the weather to determine if the day's customers might prefer warming pasta e fagioli or uplifting tagliatelle with pea shoot and almond pesto. And then he gets to work.", "Il Corvo is notable first and foremost because the pastas are soul-stirring and eloquently fashioned. But Easton's cooking also keeps returning to me because pasta culture around the country has stretched to polar extremes. In its infinite variations, the dish is rendered as either a quick hunger stopgap prepared without much finesse, or serves as a blank slate for upscale showmanship involving uni and caviar and shaved truffles. Il Corvo returns pasta to its place of essential goodness. The restaurant turns dough into happy-making strands and whimsical shapes. Beautifully pitched sauces balance acid, freshness, and heft.", " ", "Maintaining pasta's core simplicity while treating every aspect of the dish with respect did more than bring good Italian food to the neighborhood: it created community. A lovingly made pasta lunch is both so obviously satisfying and so uncommon that there's a sense of lightheartedness in the room. I've noticed no one seems overly fidgety or cranky in the line. For pasta this winning at $9 a pop, a little wait feels acceptable. Portions seem spot-on, not heaping but certainly not skimpy. (And hell, if you have a big appetite, get two pastas. The cost would still be less than the pasta dishes in many tonier restaurants.)", " ", "The service further fosters this sense of community, both in its warmth and efficiency. A sign near the entrance details the rules of etiquette: \"Order at the counter. Select a seat AFTER YOU'VE PLACED YOUR ORDER. Bus your own table. Enjoy your lunch.\" The brusque wording may have offended some customers early on, but the directives did their job: the place has a rhythm that works. Once you've paid and your lunch is ready, an available seat is never long in coming. Most of the tables are four-tops, though I've noticed groups with empty chairs often invite solo strangers to join them. It's a thoroughly democratic shindig, with people of all backgrounds and occupations crammed into the rectangular room.", " ", "Il Corvo reflects one of the most hopeful facets of our current restaurant culture, where skill, quality and price all meet to serve a city. When friends visiting Seattle ask for restaurant recommendations, I invariably send them the link to Easton's blog, where he dutifully details each day's pastas. That list sells them, and when they go they can't believe the energy, the prices, the deliciousness. Locals and travelers alike tell me they return for lunch over and over.

Although we are working to a more uniform standard, we don\u2019t want the chickens to ever all be exactly the same.\"", "The MiniMe thigh meat sandwich, like the larger one downtown, is thinner than the hefty breast meat affair at Chick-Fil-A.\u00a0It's the poultry equivalent of a smashed griddle-top burger (versus a thicker restaurant-style patty). This flatter approach results in a high ratio of crust to meat, meaning you get more crunch and crackle. The exterior's deep, dark colors evoke the mahogany hue of a skillet-fried bird. The salt levels are more restrained than at Chick-Fil-A, and the heat, a product of a habanero buttermilk brine, is intense but never painful. If you're lucky, you'll get a thick, gelatinous strip of fat on one side of the patty. Ask for daikon slaw to up the tartness factor, but really, the pickles provide sufficient acidity. As for the meat itself? It's neutral. And that's fine. You're not here to appreciate the subtleties of Poulet en Bresse; you're hear to enjoy a neutral conduit for salt and spice. You're here for a gently chewy piece of poultry that makes your jaw work just enough to let you know this came from a real animal that had an opportunity to get in a workout or two during its short life. This is a stellar sandwich.", "On Getting In: Until this week, a Fuku+ host might've told you that many of the tables were reserved for those who purchased $25 meal packages in advance, which meant you and other walk-ins were relegated to the stand-up bar.

The cost is $16 \u2014 not bad considering that the portion is enough for a party of two making open-faced sandwiches. For a heartier taste of the sea, smoked Scottish ($20) is the way to go, while sable, the bluefin tuna belly of the Lower East Side, is a stunning study in maritime oil.

Also: To-go bagel sandwiches cost $12 to $18, but the fillings, including the salmon, were cold during a recent visit.", "The \"Classic Egg Sandwich\"", "The expensive egg and cheese sandwich, which became somewhat of a symbol for the upscale-ificaiton of everything in New York when Times critic Pete Wells\u00a0penned a love letter to the $4 bodega version last spring, is here to stay, alas. Estela continues to hawk its excellent $16 version on a danish while\u00a0Santina debuted an excellent $17 version with avocado and bacon earlier this year. Sadelle's charges just as much and the ingredients are simple: two fried eggs with smoky bacon and gooey muenster on housemade challah. The result is akin to eating a French toast sandwich at a Texas state fair: Eggy, buttery bread is the de facto toast soldier to the runny yolks inside. The Monte Cristo-esque masterpiece, just like the version at Santina, easily feeds two. And that brings us to a related point...", "Before you gripe about the prices, keep in mind that most dishes here are sufficiently portioned to share. That goes for the $20 salami and mustard omelet, which tastes precisely like a New York hot dog transformed into an egg dish. And that also goes for the placemat-sized blueberry pancakes, as well as the cheese blintzes, whose mix of ricotta and cream cheese mimics the pudding-like texture of good Russian tvorog. The turkey and roast beef triple decker is a $29 mistake, a study in what happens when too much coleslaw overwhelms a pile of one-note turkey and overcooked roast beef. Also a skip are the pigs in a blanket, little different in taste and texture from the frozen Hebrew National variety.", "Weller's sticky buns and chocolate babka are close to perfect. The buns, caramel-laced laminated brioche, are an axiomatic argument in favor of replacing every cinnamon bun in America with these salty-sweet treats (on par with the excellent variety at Roberta's).

A meal at Urasawa currently starts at $395. Including one relatively modest half-bottle of sake, tax, and tip, my solo bill came in just under $650. The experience is based on kaiseki, the Japanese predecessor of tasting menus, with a choreographed sequence of small hot and cold dishes meant to kindle all the senses. Guests sit for hours while servers monitor every move, constantly replenishing drinks and explaining dishes in reverential whispers.", "So is it worth it? Obviously it depends first on whether a person finds spending that kind of money on dinner impossible, revolting, or irresistible. Local critics, interestingly, are divided. Last year Jonathan Gold of the Los Angeles Times put Urasawa at number two on his list of L.A.'s 101 Best Restaurants, noting that \"you will still find no better evocation of Japan in America.\" Los Angeles magazine just released their list of L.A.'s 75 best restaurants in its May issue, and the mag's reviewer Patric Kuh wrote a blog post explaining why he didn't include Urasawa at all: \"A prohibitively expensive Japanese restaurant inside a real estate development feels, well, kind of pass\u00e9.\"", "I did find the location disorienting. The restaurant is ensconced on the second floor of a building that's part of Two Rodeo, an outdoor shopping complex near the corner of Dayton Way and North Rodeo Drive. Google Maps couldn't quite help me pinpoint the entrance to the underground parking. I was eight minutes late to my 7:30 reservation, and one of the soft-spoken servers was waiting for me by the door. She led me to the 10-person sushi counter and, with a nod from the chef, sat me directly in front of Urasawa. There was a group of three women to my right, a party of four to my left, and empty seats on either side of me. We were the sum of the evening's customers. The room was simple, with walls painted gold and sage and white. Urasawa was dressed in a black kimono-like haori with the sleeves tied back. Blowsy cherry blossoms splayed from a vase behind him. I was flustered from being late\u2014not cool, I knew, in this regimented atmosphere. Then I ran my hands over the sandy-colored cypress bar, buffed down nightly, and exhaled. Its smooth touch relaxed me like grass under my feet.", "The first dish arrived, a slice of seared toro wrapped around ankimo (monkfish liver) and crowned with a hillock of caviar. The seafood tasted like purity itself, with the pop of the roe offsetting the play of creamy and supple textures. It made quite the first impression. And so beautiful! I pulled out my camera, and one of the servers promptly appeared at my right shoulder: \"I'm sorry, no photos.\"", "More wonderments followed, though: A variation on goma dofu, a dumpling made from black sesame paste, stuffed with uni and topped with a bit of edible gold leaf. There appeared a black spoon of half wagyu beef tartare and half caviar, finished with diced pickled radish. On the side was a small square of red pepper. \"Eat the whole spoonful,\" Urasawa said. \"Then eat the pepper.\" An earthy chaser after a decadent mouthful\u2014I liked how it jangled the brain. One of Urasawa's signatures emerged: pristine sashimi (toro, Japanese snapper, Spanish mackerel) arranged over an ice sculpture that seemed to radiate from within, like Superman's Fortress of Solitude.", "A shabu shabu course included various seafood and meats we swished around in broth and ate one at a time, in an order directed by Urasawa so each would be ideally cooked. Then the servers removed the vessel and returned with bowls of the cooking elixir. By this time I was in a trance. It wasn't until the next day I remembered the shabu shabu's climactic protein, foie gras, is banned for sale in California. Let's consider it the evening's one complimentary item. And it was extraordinarily silky.", "I started trying to sneak iPhone pics until the server came back to admonish me more firmly. It made me angry, which is not something a customer should feel when they're shelling this much out.

They adopted me as their fifth, pouring me floral sake and folding me into their conversation. We whooped together over the sushi and sighed over dessert: a slice of blessedly ripe papaya fused with a layer of grapefruit gel\u00e9e. On the side: one raw, intense yamamomo, or mountain peach. Urasawa, relaxed at meal's end, whipped frothy matcha tea with a whisk whose shape reminded me of an old-fashioned shaving brush. The group rushed in front of Urasawa and snapped his picture; I took one, too, with no resistance.", "The dinner was astonishing; I'll be judging the sushi against all others for years to come. Would I return? Probably once in a decade, and only then if I was feeling especially flush. It isn't an accessible restaurant; it wasn't designed to be. I'll confess I feel guilty over the amount of over-fished (admittedly sublime) Bluefin tuna I consumed. Urasawa receives daily seafood deliveries from Japan and uses every part of the fish, but still. I'd request my next meal sans Bluefin. The very idea would likely befuddle or sadden Urasawa. More than any taste, I'll remember the pleasure of his concentration as he formed the nigiri.

Despite the size it's possible to score reservations often in the same week.What to expect? An exquisite progression of seasonal kaiseki (small hot and cold dishes) followed by eight or ten pieces of insanely fresh sushi.  What to drink: Sake (a knowledgeable server can guide you to something in line with your price and tastes) and green tea.

The ma\u00eetre d' led us straight through the front room of VIPs\u2014there was fashion maven Andre Leon Talley holding court in a blue and white muumuu of sorts\u2014and directed us to a table in the rear. Warm goug\u00e8res arrived. We gaped at our menus full of yesteryear's rich splendors: lobster bisque, pike quenelles in Champagne sauce with caviar, oxtails braised in red Burgundy, mustardy veal kidney flamb\u00e9ed in Cognac, souffl\u00e9s, and floating islands.", "Cold salads; foie gras terrine", "During our meal, the conversation drifted, touching on places we've traveled, the fake names on our OpenTable accounts, and our disparate backgrounds. Meanwhile, the finesse of La Grenouille's food was surprising us at every course. Sweetbreads over hen-of-the-woods mushrooms had been saut\u00e9ed to exterior crispness and interior creaminess, and foie gras terrine with brioche and fig compote was textbook luscious. The shocker among the starters was Sutton's assortment of cold salads: asparagus, cucumber, julienned celery, ratatouille, cherry tomatoes, shrimp in r\u00e9moulade, and cold-poached salmon with pesto. This could have been a throwaway dish, a concession to dieters, but each element on the plate had been prepared with thought and precision.

The bird came out a just-rosy medium, as we requested. I ordered a beautiful classic: Dover sole gently grilled, with an artful slick of mustard sauce painted on the plate tableside by the august service captain. But the winner of the evening went to Sutton, who smartly opted for the pike quenelles.

The place is an antidote to many modern restaurant notions, though I found the decoration\u2014the searing orange color and humongous flower arrangements that threatened to consume entire tables\u2014somewhat over the top.

It's one of my favorite things in the world (I probably have my Russophilia to blame).

My ideal is Shawn Gale's buckwheat souffl\u00e9 from Saison in San Francisco.", "The other dessert was the oeufs a la neige, essentially \u00eeles flottantes.

Quivering asparagus flan barely contains a quail egg aching to ooze. Onions, caramelized for half a day into a chocolaty jam, are encircled with a crepe, baked with parmesan, and lowered into a pool of white truffle fondue. Speckled brown butter coats chubby orbs of spinach gnocchi; it came paired with almond tortellini caught in a sweet-savory tug of war between crushed amaretti cookies and glossy white truffle sauce.

The result is intensely saline, which Leonti ameliorates by dousing the quail with a fragrant syrup from Alto Adige made from pine cone buds. It smells like a freshly cut lawn on a fall day.", "Leonti is shrewd in his tinkerings with pasta. A riff on the American idea of soup/salad/pasta comes in one bowl: A silky agnolotto filled with julienned zucchini ribbons in a moss green moat fashioned solely from pistachios, onions, water, and olive oil.

The tiny dining room\u2014separated by a service station adorned with vases of sunflowers, an antique cake dome, and other quirky knickknacks\u2014has just enough tables to feel congenial rather than cramped.

Caballo mans the kitchen; Nemeth oversees service and occasionally jumps on the line as well.", "They both left jobs in Toronto to travel and work abroad in Spain and Italy (among other places) for several years before returning home. The food has the savor of someone who absorbed Europe's modern culinary culture at a leisured pace rather than in a fevered expedition. The ever-changing dishes Caballo sends out in five- or seven-course menus aren't exactly homey, but they taste the way I'd imagined Caballo would cook if he were trying to impress guests at his own dining table. Customers can call ahead to request extra dishes like the truffled chicken or paella or canard a la press (the baroque recipe for duck in blood sauce developed at La Tour d'Argent), classic preparations that Caballo and Nemeth prepare simply because they enjoy them.", "", "Though luxuries from up and down the food chain appear throughout dinner, Caballo favors seafood and vegetables. Fluke, cured in sake and seaweed, arrived as the first course in a shimmery glass bowl, bathed in a cooling cucumber seed dashi and overlaid with stalks of sea asparagus as thin as rose stems. Nova Scotia lobster with Australian black winter truffles (a hint of what would come with the chicken) came suspended in an astringent, palate-perking gelee of young, foraged grapes. The flavors warmed with the next two dishes: house-smoked eel with chanterelles and cauliflower in matelote sauce (which includes red wine, fish stock, and cr\u00e8me fraiche) and octopus grilled over charcoal over a rich corn emulsion with radishes and basil sprouts. Smoked duck breast with hunks of feisty duck sausage and morsels stuffed silky foie gras primed the taste buds for the forthcoming chicken. Afterwards the wild strawberry-patterned plates came out flaunting blueberries, blackberries, cherries, and fresh currants in cream with dabs of elderberry jelly. A dreamy summer conclusion.", "The cocoon created by the doting staff and the candle-lit room took the evening to another level. Nemeth and other servers beamed every time they appeared, describing the apple nose of a Taiheizan sake or gushing over the Basque teardrop peas a local farmer grows just for the restaurant. It was as much a conversation as it was feast, without being obtrusive or overly earnest. The tables were close enough to allow for good-natured eavesdropping: Across from us sat a restaurant-industry couple celebrating their third anniversary; next to us were two longtime friends catching up.

Precision-engineered margaritas smoothed the conversion. Two years later the Baylesses launched fine-dining Topolobampo in a room off one side of Frontera.

Roasted purple potatoes achieved similarly profound flavor steeped in chileatole, a cross between a soup and a beverage thickened with corn masa and aromatic from guajillo chiles and musky epazote.

Toasted ancho chile and browned butter gave the composition some heft, and the spray of edible herbs and flowers atop were of course from Bayless's rooftop garden overhead.

The novel-seeming collard sandwich, glossed with melty cheddar and homemade mayo between layers of moist slabs of cornbread, takes its cues from a concoction\u00a0favored by the Lumbee Indians in North Carolina.", "Fehribach credits reading The Taste of Country Cooking \u2014 written by Southern doyenne Edna Lewis \u2014 with deepening his approach to the food at Big Jones. Lewis served as muse for the restaurant\u2019s clamored-after fried chicken. It bubbles in a combination of lard, ham drippings, and clarified butter.

Yellow and red Oaxacan moles pooled around the tamale in a multihued pottery bowl; crema and black speckles of vegetable ash crowned it. The swirl of flavors and textures and colors and histories in every spoonful made the U.S. border feel very far away.", "Dessert nearly dislodged my reverie. A server delivered a pure white bowl mounded with an equally colorless foam. I leaned down and sniffed: truffle oil mousse. I loathe few things more than truffle oil. Happily, there was so much going on underneath \u2014 caramel panna cotta, a \"chlorophyll sauce\" made from spinach and mint, the crunch of pistachios (plucked from the trees of Russian farmers across the way) \u2014 that the stinky whiff faded to a pheromone. Hern\u00e1ndez-Baquedano told me later the creation was a finale he'd first unveiled this past New Year's Eve that had been in and out of rotation since then. The dessert's global bent jarred me back to reality enough that I considered asking for another order of lech\u00f3n.

An assortment includes petite slices of translucent spot prawn along with the critter's upper body, the eyes clear and its antennae and spindly legs still occasionally undulating.

It comes overlaid with a lettuce leaf and one precious lobe of the sea urchin roe that is plucked from nearby San Diego waters and delivered daily in wooden boxes.

This place draws the connoisseurs, and plenty of them: On a Tuesday night waiting customers spilled onto the sidewalks of the Pacific Beach strip mall that's been home to Yukito Ota's restaurant since its inception in 1990. In Los Angeles, the seat of sushi culture in the U.S., Sushi Ota would likely be regarded as a respected neighborhood player. Japanese cuisine certainly thrives in San Diego, and outside of L.A.'s hundreds of options it's easier for Ota's venerable merits to be recognized.

Dishes came rapid-fire after the uni and spot prawn rhapsody: a mix of lobster and snow crab baked in a lobster shell under a stratum of mayo and eel sauce; a tempura course with shrimp, baby okra, shiitakes, and Japanese rockfish; and a nigiri assortment of yellowtail, salmon belly, halibut, silvery-skinned kohada (Japanse shad), and another piece of the lyrical uni.

It was sacs of baked cod semen, typically available only in winter. It looked like alabaster brains but possessed a decidedly singular creaminess.

Yuzu's sunny flavor brightened the dish, though honestly it was potent enough that a few bites sufficed. A cup of miso soup with clams made for a tame denouement to the meal.

Each maw was stuffed: one with sultry pulled pork paired with cubes of guayan\u00e9s, a white cheese whose texture resides somewhere between feta and ricotta salata; another filled with ropy beef shards and an oozier cheese; and a third crammed with shredded chicken salad bound in garlicky mayo and tinted lime green from avocado.", "With the food, a cook delivered a squirt bottle full of guasacaca, a thin avocado salsa pinged with vinegar that snapped the flavors at hand to attention.

Dependable Cuban sandwich cafes thrive, and there are the homegrown successes like Michael's Genuine Food &amp; Drink in the Design District and Miami Beach's Pubbelly that have spawned flourishing restaurant groups. But the city also rivals Las Vegas in its appetite for glittery concepts imported by national and international celebrity chefs. The lure of their bespangled dining rooms, housed mostly in hotels and resorts along the water, proves powerful. Over the years, though, I've found too many of them inconsistent, particularly beyond the first months in business when the parent company turns its attention to the next project. Even spinoffs from local talent can be uneven: A recent lunch at Seagrape \u2014 a new restaurant in the freshly renovated Thompson Hotel helmed by Michelle Bernstein, a chef whose food I usually admire \u2014 proved a letdown with fishy grilled snapper and lackluster salads.", "So for a deeper look into the city's dining culture, I decided to home in on Miami's Latin flavors and see where they led. Cuban exiles began enriching the city's culture as far back as 1959. In the half-century since, South Florida has become a magnet for immigrants from countries all across the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Color detonates from every corner of the restaurant; murals by Haitian artists cover the walls and the tables. Tourists as well as local Haitian expats fill the labyrinth of dining rooms, sipping rum cocktails laced with passion fruit or lime and sharing dishes like fried chunks of goat with a vinegary dipping sauce; grilled conch, chewy but satisfying; and shrimp in coconut sauce. I hadn't been to Tap Tap in a decade. This time I was particularly taken with a plate of spaghetti tossed with tomato, onion, and potent, anchovy-like bits of herring.

Drizzles of guava sauce provided tropical-sweet complexity. Ara\u00f1itas de platano (shredded green plantain fritters) were fun but probably redundant when ordering mofongo, the traditional dish of fried and mashed plantains in which Carey takes pride. I asked the two staffers which protein I should order with my mofongo. \"Mahi,\" they said in unison. It was an unexpected answer but sound advice, the fish pleasantly oceanic against the earthy mound of plantains and the moat of tomato-based Creole sauce.", "Little Bread Cuban Sandwich Co.'s Media noche croquetas and Cubano", "Of course my quest needed at least a quick dive into Cuban food. When I inquired after the city's model Cuban sandwich, several locals pointed me to\u00a0Enriqueta's, a breakfast and lunch staple in Wynwood long before the community began its ascent into gentrification. It was the Cubano of the mind's eye and palate, the shiny, oblong bread griddled to crispness and the pressed stack of thinly sliced meats exclamatory with mustard and pickles. It held up well against a powerhouse new Little Havana contender,\u00a0Little Bread Cuban Sandwich Co.,\u00a0launched in November by Alberto Cabrera. He also operates Bread + Butter in Coral Gables, where he serves pork-filled empanadas, grits with oxtail meat, and other dishes inspired by his Cuban-American heritage.", "Before opening Little Bread, Cabrera visited Cochon Butcher in New Orleans as creative stimulus for\u00a0re-engineering his version of the Cubano. His cooks stack black forest ham, salami, pork belly rillettes, and Swiss cheese; heat them on a baking sheet in a massive red smoker for a few minutes; and then transfer them to a squishy toasted roll slathered with mustard aioli and pickled mustard seeds. The bread didn't have the archetypal crunch, but in every other way it was a superior sandwich. A fun appetizer of croquetas suffused with the flavors of a media noche, the Cubano variation made with sweet bread, reinforced how masterfully Cabrera owns this iconic mix of flavors and textures.", "Arroz con mariscos at La Mar", "Peruvian is arguably Miami's most in-demand Latin American cuisine after Cuban. As in cities like New York and San Francisco, the multicultural food of Peru (which includes Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and African influences) has been cast locally in a fine-dining limelight.

Rich in woods and touches of turquoise, the place clicked as a group destination: We passed platters of causas (potatoes whipped with aji chile and topped with whimsies such as beet, crab, avocado, and fried kale) and marveled over a version of fideos fashioned using squid ink pappardelle. And a second outpost of downtown Miami restaurant\u00a0Ceviche 105 on Lincoln Road successfully remade itself in a South Beach image, all sleek lines and sexy shadows and outbursts of tropical hues. The surprise? How homespun the food tasted. Each ceviche showed distinct personality; most memorable was a pale version of seafood draped in pisco cream sauce with a nutty, sherry-like flavor.", "El Cielo recalls the sillier facets of U.S. molecular gastronomy madness from a decade ago", "People of Colombian heritage outnumber those of Peruvian ancestry in Miami-Dade County, though the meaty, hearty cooking of Colombia isn't nearly as prominent in the city. For nearly two years, though, Miamians have been anticipating the arrival of El Cielo, a modernist high-flyer from 31-year-old Colombian chef Juan Manuel Barrientos. His outpost in Brickell is his third restaurant and his first beyond his native country.", "El Cielo was the last meal of my trip. The  restaurant was still in soft-opening phase, only two weeks open. For  Miami it seemed such a leap forward for Colombian cuisine that I  couldn\u2019t resist. Barrientos made his name on fanciful presentations like  yuca and cheese bread suspended on a \"tree of life\" made of copper  wire. I\u2019m guessing, though, that he might quickly drop some aspects to  his 15-course tasting menu that recall the sillier facets of U.S.  molecular gastronomy madness from a decade ago. For example, after a  starting round of empanadas and ropa vieja splattered with peanut sauce,  my friend and I soon had metal bowls in front of us. A staffer then  carried over a carafe of rose-scented, Pepto-bismol pink goo and poured  it over our hands. We were supposed to rub the stuff vigorously between  our palms and roll it into balls: It turned tacky for a minute before  dripping off our fingers.

Minced habaneros, mint, basil, and cilantro stowed away in the fray. Stirred together, it was the taste of a Southeast Asian island cuisine yet to be discovered: floral and tropical met fire and spice, crisp collided with creamy. A surprise arrived with the dish.

Our stomachs were already full when a family-style platter of smoked brisket arrived. Its lush fattiness and deep infusion of smoke would, I wager, draw nods of approval from Texans. Most of it (and the accompanying horseradish cream, toast, and vinaigrette-slicked slaw) was consumed as leftovers.

A quail egg, moored by a dollop of preserved ginger, had been lightly smoked in tea and brown sugar and set in a moat of smooth cabbage and onion soup scented with bacon. Rousong\u2014pork braised and then dried, also known aptly as \"meat floss\"\u2014was scattered over the egg to give the dish a bit of chew. Bright, rich, soothing, varied: This warm-up nudged the taste buds to attention.", "Then the true kindling of the senses began. An ornate black vessel arrived containing one elaborate bite. It resembled siu mai, the open-faced dim sum dumpling usually filled with pork and shrimp. This version was stuffed with pork belly, diced kimchi, and a tiny oyster on top. The wrapper looked cast in amber\u2014a technique from the modernist playbook in which kimchi broth was set with hydrocolloids to give it body and then dried until pliant. By the time it reached the table it was akin to edible glass. In one bite the wrapper crackled into tingly shards before dissolving, leaving the soft burn of kimchi and the proteins' crisscross of earth-sea flavors. My tablemate and I looked at each other wide-eyed and laughed. What would be next?", "Many, many pleasures, from a mind that stands alone among the country's vanguard of fine dining. Lee\u201436 years-old, born in Korea, raised in New Jersey\u2014felt the call of refined cooking early. He worked in Pied \u00e0 Terre and La Tante Claire in London before he was 21, moved to New York for stints in the kitchens of Daniel and Lespinasse, and then spent nine years with Thomas Keller. He was the chef de cuisine at The French Laundry before he opened Benu. What Lee gleaned from Keller was a confidence in his upbringing as a culinary bedrock. Keller famously took Americanisms like mac and cheese or peas and carrots and reconstructed them using Escoffier's techniques and California's bounty. Lee has fashioned a coexistence cuisine that honors both his Asian and American selves. It takes mettle. Upscale renderings of sea cucumber and salt-and-pepper squid don't pack the reservation books quite like pasta snowed under with shaved truffles does.", "Not that Benu is empty. A mix of casually dressed tech types and suited Asian businesspeople kept the restaurant humming and the people-watching prime on the night I dined there. But it is easier to snag a table here than, say, Saison, or certainly The French Laundry.", "Beggar's purse; Oyster, pork, and kimchi dumpling", "And yet, for seasoned diners, I'd currently recommend Benu for a splurge over all the other blowout restaurants in the Bay Area. The cost is on par, perhaps slightly more reasonable by comparison, with other high-rollers: Tasting menus, the only option, are $195 per person. (The French Laundry starts at $295, though that price includes service.) More importantly, the food at Benu bridges East and West like nothing I've ever tried before. Unlike his peers, who often look first to Japan among the Asian nations for inspiration, Lee looks primarily to his native Korea and to China. His rigorous, brainy cooking has become more grounded in those countries since Benu opened in 2010. Then, he may have slipped sweetbreads or risotto into the sequence. Those types of dishes are less frequent now, which makes meals even more of a mind-opening delight.", "Much of what sets the restaurant apart is the Asian emphasis on texture. Of course all chefs think about textural contrast\u2014the handful of breadcrumbs over spaghetti, a sprinkling of candied walnuts in the salad. But in Lee's kitchen the tactile sensation moves to the forefront. Take a chicken-based soup that appeared halfway through the meal. The star ingredient was wild bamboo fungus, which in its natural state resembles white asparagus stalks and has a consistency that brings to mind tripe and honeycomb. It hit the palate slippery but then snapped between the teeth. The effect fascinated and its umami earthiness gratified.", "Ditto Lee's take on shark's fin soup. The prized part of the swimmer was always more about its feathery elasticity than its flavor. Mindful of the way shark species are endangered by brutal fishing practices, Lee employs more modernist lab work to approximate the fin, which he serves in a bowl with Dungeness crab, custard infused with Chinese ham, and a broth perfumed with truffles and ginger.", "XO Sausage with basil curd; Salt-and-pepper-squid", "I loved the studied way our meal unfolded. The soup and the engineered dumpling introduced us to Lee's mindset, and then a progression of finger foods followed: Eel in crisp feuille de brick pastry, a riff on spring rolls, with a blob of cr\u00e8me fraiche for swiping. An angular sliver of celery capped with caramelized anchovy and peanut. A spoonful of silky tofu made with sunflower miso. A metal skewer impaled with sausage made from pork and dried scallops and shrimp, with a square of basil-infused bean curd. A luxe beggar's purse of \"treasures from the oak,\" marrying acorn flour (a prominent ingredient in Korean cooking) and a filling of Iberico ham from pigs that were fed acorns and truffles that grow under oak trees. Genius! Then a play on salt-and-pepper squid\u2014a crackery squid ink rice ship dotted with a gentle confit of squid, garlic puree, pickled chiles, and cilantro shoots. The progression was startling and fun\u2014and with minimal exchanges of silverware, it made for a gracious balance between service interaction and our own engaged conversation.", "Sea bream with aged tangerine peel", "The thrilling juxtapositions never let up. Soup dumplings awash in lobster coral were also laced with clarified butter, evoking the American penchant for lobster with drawn butter. Aged tangerine peel brought a citrus intensity to a tiny sea bream that enhanced without overwhelming. An optional sea cucumber course for a $25 surcharge brought texture to spare, stuffed with a shrimp mousse that emphasized the creature's spongy texture rather than masking it. Ballsy, and also rewarding. Hot mustard and fermented Chinese black olives gave roasted quail, the most Western-looking of the dishes, a distinct Asian pungency. Lee has access to sake lees (the byproduct of making the beverage) due to connections with sake producers in Sacramento, and he paired the fruity, cheese-like ingredient winningly with strawberry sorbet. The finale brought a pale orb of fresh and dried tofu skin\u2014imagine the al dente bite of a fruit rollup but milkier\u2014filled with almond and white chocolate. Glorious textures right to the sweet conclusion.", "Four years into Benu, Lee is now tackling other projects. In the next month he'll open Monsieur Benjamin, a return to Lee's roots with casual French cooking. And though he doesn't yet have a location, Lee plans to next launch a Korean barbecue restaurant.

I opted for the $55 drink pairings with the $95 menu, and the brothy egg yolk number suffered the most discordant coupling\u2014a Junmei sake that came off like rubbing alcohol (and I'm often a fan of sake pairings).", "The Central Coast; Halibut with nasturtium sauce; Frozen duck liver with smoked maple syrup and coffee granola", "Among the two most complex creations, one seduced and the other ambushed. Crumbled bits of frozen duck liver with smoked maple syrup and coffee granola was all modern wit, a pile of rubble and smoldering flavors that evoked breakfast around a dying campfire. But the main dessert\u2014a white chocolate semifreddo spritzed with spruce oil\u2014hid a palate-jarring gelee made from an aggressively hoppy IPA, which literally left a bitter taste in my mouth.", "Departing, I thought back to the snacks that landed on the table before the main courses began. Delicate seaweed and tofu beignets, the standouts, were crowd favorites when Alma was in its early days and served an a la carte menu. He could have stuck with that format, but I can see Taymor is probably too zealous for lists of appetizers and entrees. I taste ambition in his food. It'll be fascinating to see what kind of chef he develops into even a year from now.", "[Matt Kang/Eater LA]", "Like scoring seats to watch a rock god play an intimate venue, the effort to dine at Trois Mec pays off in every way. Anyone tracking the LA dining scene at all knows about this collaboration between three headliners\u2014Ludo Lefebvre, Vinny Dotolo, and Jon Shook. Lefebvre was chef at Gallic luminaries like L'Orangerie and Bastide and then found his true m\u00e9tier staging sold-out pop-ups called LudoBites; he's one of the judges on The Taste alongside Nigella Lawson and Anthony Bourdain. Dotolo and Shook, two Florida boys, brought rockabilly edge to Southern California cooking at Animal and Son of a Gun. The duo councils on food and business matters at Trois Mec but Lefebvre runs the kitchen most nights.

Straight away, a cook passed us earthen cups filled with buckwheat popcorn, which crunched and twanged like Grape Nuts crossed with salt and vinegar potato chips. Among the speedy succession of snacks was a square of garlic bread, an homage to the surroundings that recalled the yeasty, cheesy perfume that hangs in the air of every college town slice joint.", "Dungeness crab ceviche; Striped bass with white asparagus; Beef tenderloin with smoked peanut butter, charred broccoli, and shallot bits.", "But any cutesy allusions disappeared with the first course\u2014a lilting Dungeness crab ceviche dotted with citrus and snug beneath sheer avocado slices. Like the crab dish at Alma, the composition distilled the Golden State in a few dreamy bites.", "But then the dinner grew more exhilarating. A grilled cabbage leaf accented with grated egg yolk and draped over smoked almond milk anglaise and miso flan has been a part of the menu for months. It's not particularly seasonal; the combinations sound random. It was genius, though\u2014the ingredients conspired to bring out the sweetness in cabbage's personality, an intervention to coax out its highest potential. Equally sublime courses ensued: steamed striped bass gently buoyed by white asparagus, fried fennel fronds, and petals of yucca flowers; strips of beef punched up with smoked peanut butter, charred broccoli, and a shower of crisp shallot bits.", "General manager Adam Vourvoulis compiled two French-leaning wine pairings, a $49 option and a $79 reserve upgrade, drawing on Chinons and Burgundies as well as more obscure varietals like Sylvaner and Savenni\u00e8res.

The road leads past the glittery Fox Theatre (with its eight-story marquee flanked by winged lions), Comerica Park where the Tigers roam on their home turf, and the Detroit Institute of Arts that houses its collections in a palatial Italian Renaissance building. Along the street one also glimpses derelict blocks, empty apartment buildings, and poignant markers like \"St. Curvy,\" an abandoned turreted church nicknamed by long-ago parishioners for its winding balcony.", "The ride can stir up a blur of emotions. But after dining at Ferndale's destination restaurant, it's easy to feel hopeful for what's next. Torino is an unlikely stage for some of the country's most promising culinary talent. It sits at the bottom of a condo building and opened as an espresso and cocktail bar in 2011. In January 2013 Torino owner Noah Dorfman was introduced to Garrett Lipar, a native of nearby Waterford Township and a young chef with serious wanderlust. Not yet 25 at the time, he'd already powered through positions at New York's Public, Chicago's Boka, and Frantzen in Stockholm, and staged at many other star-chasers, Alinea among them. Along the way, he'd been indoctrinated into the creeds of tasting menus and modernist techniques.", "Smoked Pike", "Lipar and Dorfman, energized by their mutual ambitions, decided to go all in. In May 2013 Lipar began serving prix-fixe meals, with the cooks working on an induction stovetop (no gas ranges allowed in the space) in a kitchen no bigger than a coat-check closet at a posh steakhouse. In the first months the menus were three courses for $34 or five for $52 and they changed weekly. New Nordic flavors\u2014flowers and dill cream, a focus on seafood\u2014came into play. Locally sourced ingredients met liquid nitrogen and Japanese smokers. Nothing outr\u00e9 for New York or San Francisco, but radical for Michigan. Diners came slowly at first, but then word started to circulate and the critics began praising. In March the Detroit Free Press named Torino its Restaurant of the Year. Last month Lipar was named to Eater's Young Guns Class of 2014.", "Skeptical that this might be a case of overreaching greenhorns in a market hungry for some dazzle, I almost skipped Torino. I'm so glad I didn't. It was the most rewarding surprise of my travels thus far. Lipar has the gift for composing tasting menus, drawing on various genres as his own style emerges and evolves. In June, he decided to offer nine courses for $89 and change the menu once a month\u2014a wise choice that allows the kitchen staff to fully master each course.", "Apricot with nasturtium", "The first dish of the July lineup was a three-component bento box, each filled with summer squash: gently fermented slivers dotted with milkweed flowers; a battered squash blossom stuffed with pinto beans uplifted by summer truffles; and tiny zucchini, patty pan, and zephyr squashes grilled over a yakatori with sour beer foam spooned over them. Each element had the alchemical touch of a skilled chef: They tasted fresh and true to their essence but also amplified. The dishes grew incrementally more complex as the meal careened on. Apricot slowly simmered in whey turned savory, with verdant blasts from nasturtium flowers and young green grapes that resembled English peas. Asparagus arrived alongside a pool of savory chocolate sauce\u2014a mole for vegetables. Fried eggplant stuffed with roasted heirloom tomatoes became a brilliant riff on moussaka, with warm gazpacho filling in for tomato sauce and honey aioli standing in for b\u00e9chamel.", "Suckling pig; strawberry and spruce dessert", "More protein-driven courses of smoked pike and suckling pig  gave way to the two most modernist creations. First, a sweet-savory palate refresher of shiso-green grape sorbet over compressed cucumber, briny from vinegar and simple syrup and decorated with vinegar gelee and Marcona almonds. It was all covered with yogurt snow, the tableau a reminder that Michigan's cold months are never too far away. Dessert was the evening's most esoteric effort\u2014strawberries with angel food cake ice cream, house-made fromage blanc with macerated spruce buds, and other iterations of spruce and berry in the forms of powders, crisps, and caramels\u2014but the components all merged in a way that satisfied rather than bewildered. As a finale, black garlic caramels and chocolates filled with aloe vera marmalade appeared with a sustaining cup of Sumatran coffee, a wink at Torino's origins.", "Many liquid pleasures came before the java. Lipar has an advocate on the floor with beverage manager Ian Redmond. Starting off with a cocktail like Nigel's Magic Carpet (jasmine-infused gin, Luxardo Maraschino, cr\u00e8me de violet, sloe gin, and lemon) acclimated the palate for the journey ahead. And Redmond made choices for his $45 wine pairing that coaxed even more out of Lipar's cooking. A minerally Domaine Qu\u00e9nard white from France's Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes helped the stone fruit flavors resurface in the apricot. And he wittily chose a Greek Xinomavro with the tomato-eggplant dish to emphasize its moussaka-like characteristics.", "This team of emerging talents could surely disband and find success individually in other cities.

And it is long enough (nine plus-courses) to make the eight-month old venue feel like another manifestation of The Destination Neighborhood Restaurant, a local spot attracting, whether intentionally or not, a citywide and sometimes countrywide following. Dover's culinary team, Joe Ogrodnek and Walker Stern, were the only two New York delegates in Food &amp; Wine's 2014 class of \"best new chefs.\" Bon Appetit named sister spot Battersby the third best new U.S. restaurant for 2012. And GQ named the then three month-old Dover one of the 25 best new restaurants in America in March. Congratulations.", "Too bad Dover isn't equipped to offer its most expensive wares to those crossing borough lines, never mind state lines. The $35 caviar pie is a study in how much uninformed diners will pay for mushy, low-grade paddlefish roe. The $65 chicken barely rises above the level of mediocrity \u2014 a bland, under-salted breast in an otherwise fine piperade, and a floppy-skinned thigh in a more concentrated pepper jus. ", "And then there's the tasting, which Dover says about 25 percent of the guests order most nights. One of the first courses on a recent Friday was a tiny ramekin of what we (correctly) guessed to be gazpacho; the waiter's description was barely audible amid the din of the room. Is there a bit of oxidized gray around the foie gras torchon, and a bit of sinew inside? Hard to tell because the lighting's too dark at Dover post-sunset. A cozy bistro serving grilled skirt steak can keep things dim, but part of the fun at a tasting menu spot is taking in the beauty of the composed dishes in full Technicolor.", "Grilled tuna and chickpea fries", "There are flashes of genius during the tasting, just not enough. Rare grilled tuna, the throwaway dish of the early aughts, finds new relevance here. The interior is cool and crimson while the toro-like edges are oily and oozing with umami-rich maritime flavor. The fish sits in a pool of intense red pepper sauce and is topped with chickpea fries for dunking. Even better are ruby red shrimp from Maine, packing the distinct iodine tang you'd expect from the regal Mediterranean crevette. Dover tosses the bite-sized crustaceans into a pool of white almond soup so silky and tart that it could command 100 euros at Alain Ducasse's Le Louis XV in Monaco. ", "Then you encounter a tomato, burrata, and strawberry salad that's little different from something your hedge fund buddy made last week at his Hamptons pool party. There's also pici pasta with butter, chanterelles, and parsley, which are coated with so many sandy breadcrumbs it's as if someone accidentally dropped the noodles on East Rockaway Beach. Lamb ribs with eggplant and mint feels less like a composed dish, more like three disparate ingredients thrown into a single bowl.

Mark Marhefka \u2014 a second-generation fisherman who runs a small business called Abundant Seafood \u2014 catches the iridescent blue fish and delivers them to Charleston chefs clamoring for a local catch. None likely render the mackerel's oily richness more delectably than Mike Lata, one of Marhefka's steadiest customers. At FIG (\"Food Is Good\"), the restaurant Lata opened in 2003, he recently smoked the fish and arranged generous slices around Napa cabbage cooked down to lushness and mixed with chopped egg. In the center he piled trout roe and the dish's one overt wink to the region: whipped buttermilk. The flavors more reflected the province of New York delis (via Eastern European cooking traditions) than Southern kitchens. It didn't matter. The combination seduced the palate the same way the harmonics of a Beach Boys tune hook the ears.", "FIG was among a new generation of Charleston restaurants that led the city to modern culinary acclaim, and a decade later the attention is nowhere close to letting up. It helps, of course, that the 350-year-old city is one of the most visited places in America. Around 5 million travelers amble along Charleston's cobblestoned streets annually, and plenty of them come expressly to eat. It keeps the dining scene electric and competitive. And yet, similar to New Orleans, the best of the established restaurants in Charleston continue to improve. Though I'm always curious about the latest openings, this is a place where, more than most, I find myself compelled to return to a handful of stalwarts each visit.", "Nine vegetable salad and Smoked king mackerel over Napa cabbage at FIG.", "Sean Brock's\u00a0Husk is one of them. So is FIG. The menu entwines Italian, French, and New American notions and reads like the kind of fine-ish dining restaurant you can find in most cities across the country. The kitchen consistently overachieves, though, and so does the present, graceful front-of-house staff. They'll likely steer the table toward seafood dishes. Heed them. One week Lata and executive chef Jason Stanhope will showcase lean, mustard-crusted amberjack glossed with brown butter and capers, or cook grouper, mild in flavor and texture, in sherry sauce with spaghetti squash; the next will feature roasted black bass accented simply with breadcrumbs, garlic, and oregano.", "Start the meal on land with pudgy gnocchi in Bolognese, a deserving staple. And at this time of year, Lata, a New England native, favors Nantucket Bay scallops, served as crudo with tangerine, pine nuts, and peppery olive oil, or in a tart gilded with sabayon scented with pastis.", "Above: The Ordinary exterior; Left: King mackerel crudo; Right: Fried oysters and beef tartare", "Marhefka's recent mackerel catch also showed up at The Ordinary, the oyster hall that Lata and business partner Adam Nemirow launched in 2012. Raw slivers stood up to heady accompaniments: mint salsa verde, forest-green dollops of charred scallion vinaigrette, mood ring-shaped slices of pickled hearts of palm, and a squeeze of grapefruit-like citrumelo. It was the kind of bold plate I've often enjoyed perched at the long bar, sipping a sparkling ros\u00e9 or a cocktail that headlines rum, a longtime favorite of Charlestonians. The place instantly feels like an entrenched part of the dining landscape, housed in 1920s-era bank transformed into a grand dining hall with 22-foot ceilings. The steel vault door, now lined with gleaming white tile, acts as a kitchen window; it sits behind an oyster bar where staffers frantically shuck bivalves stacked on crushed ice.", "Delicate treats like lobster bisque with blue crab dumplings or baked porgy in an emulsion of butter and vin jaune (sherry-like wine from France's Jura region) impress but don't pull focus from oysters considered through myriad presentations: as stars on shellfish towers or (in the case of lanky, local Caper's Blades) dolloped \"Moscow style\" with cr\u00e8me fraiche and caviar; smoked over alder wood and served on Saltines, needing nothing else; fried crisp and paired for contrast with beef tartare; or battered and piled on fluffy rolls as sliders, to be greedily consumed in two bites.", "Hominy Grill", "If Mike Lata represents the untethered creativity that local ingredients can inspire, then Robert Stehling and his Hominy Grill offer a window into traditional Lowcountry recipes. This is the place to savor creamy she-crab soup laced with sherry, chicken bog (a kin of jambalaya cooked with rice and sausage), chicken country captain (served in curried tomato sauce), and gossamer coconut layer cake. If you show up at Hominy at 12:30 p.m. on a Sunday, the restaurant can at first feel like a tourist trap: Dozens of people may be waiting for a table, and the take-out window for beverages near the entrance can run out of coffee. But the food never tastes compromised: The Charleston Nasty biscuit will still include a crackling-hot hunk of fried chicken smothered in melting cheddar and finely tuned sausage gravy.", "Better, though, to arrive on a weekday afternoon or evening, when the two dining rooms in the historic clapboard house are quieter, to enjoy a vegetable plate with Charleston red rice (amped with bacon and tomato paste) and collard greens, or a catfish po' boy. At any time of day \u2014 breakfast included \u2014 the shrimp and grits are available. Stehling's honors lineage as much as geography: His version hews closely to the one perfected by his mentor, the late Bill Neal of Crooks Corner in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. It's a straightforward pool of cheese grits heaped with a lemony tumble of shrimp, crumbled bacon, mushrooms, and scallions. I don't ever need to eat another plate of overwrought shrimp and grits; this is the only rendition I crave.", "Left: Charleston Navy biscuit; Right: Buttermilk pie; Below: Shrimp and grits", "After sating my appetite for the city's exemplars on a recent trip, I did check out two exceptional newcomers. Friends sent me far up King Street to Leon's Oyster Shop, an airy hangout in a former auto garage co-owned by Brooks Reitz, who managed FIG and then The Ordinary. Reitz's chef, Ari Kolender, bridges the flavor spectrum between regional and global. Every table has at least one order of char-grilled oysters, piled on a plate with batons of toast for sopping up the puddles of butter and parmesan that remain in the shells. A list of easygoing small plates includes avocado toast, fried Brussels sprouts, and Siam salad, a whirl of Napa cabbage, avocado, orange segments, herbs, and fried shallots. It's the oysters and the fried chicken I'll return for, though. In a city (and world) agog with fried chicken, Kolender nevertheless serves impeccable fowl: The bird stays succulent under a bronze veneer of breading that almost shatters like caramelized sugar.", "Fried oyster sandwich at ; Pickled shrimp on toast at Edmund's Oast", "The poultry specialty at Edmund's Oast wades even more deeply into comfort food realms. Lemony chicken rice porridge is ideal for Charleston's cooler months. Made with fragrant, locally grown Carolina Gold rice and topped with crabmeat and scallions, the porridge recalls Asian congee: It soothes the nervous system and rouses hunger. And thirst \u2014 which Edmund's is more than equipped to quench. Owners Scott Shor and Rich Carley opened South Carolina's first craft beer shop in 2007. Cocktails like the Tchoupitoulas Sling (cognac, Rittenhouse Rye, absinthe, Benedictine, Peychaud's bitters) show mastery of balance, but beer, including several house-made brews, is the official house drink. One wall displays forty beer taps, their wooden handles lined like posts of an unpainted picket fence.", "Given the seriousness of the charcuterie program and the obvious talents of chef Andy Henderson (who also previously worked under Mike Lata), it's safe to call Edmund's\u00a0a gastropub. Henderson sends out winning plates like silky butternut squash blistered on the plancha and sharpened with cilantro-pecan pesto. A generous filet of black sea bass arrives speckled with brown butter, alongside farro and cabbage cooked risotto style, and softened with a nage of milk and Meyer lemon. Visitors and locals alike crowd the vast, open room: Wood beam ceilings offset dramatic, spindly chandeliers; two long communal tables separate the endless bar from a row of booths.

Open since 2010, it quickly came to symbolize all the \"re\" words ascribed to Southern food's ascendance over the last decade: revival, relish, reclamation, refinement, and even (in backlash to the cuisine's perceived overexposure) rejection. Not that there's any evidence of rebuff at Husk: People ceaselessly congregate on the whitewashed porch overlooking Queen Street, awaiting entrance for Sean Brock's pimento cheese crostini and duck leg in red eye gravy. Of all the chefs and writers who have salvaged, heralded, and personalized Southern cooking in recent years, Brock has the most extreme curiosity. His zealotry \u2014 as a cook, but also as a farmer and curator \u2014 is thoroughly documented in articles and on television. No regional heirloom seed is too obscure, no breed of pig too ornery.", "Husk's kitchen philosophy is, \"If it doesn't come from the South, it's not coming through the door.\" It delivered to Charleston diners a cross-section of regional ingredients, some prepared with a mind to tradition (rabbit stew with dumplings, fried okra, corn fritters) and others straight from Brock's thunderbolt imagination (pig's ears lettuce wraps and fried chicken skins, both of which became menu mainstays). In May 2013 Brock and Neighborhood Dining Group president David Howard opened a second Husk in Nashville. The location wasn\u2019t chosen simply because of Music City\u2019s percolating dining scene. It was a return performance: Brock held his first executive chef position in the city.", "The two Husks share many similarities, beginning with Victorian mansion settings, but the 550 miles between them has allowed each to develop distinct, rooted identities.", "At lunch last month, the fried chicken skins ranked as the best I've had among my half a dozen meals at Husk over the years. A pile of them \u2014 plenty, but not too many \u2014 came on a knobby, hollowed wooden plank. The size of elongated peanuts, the skins first soaked in buttermilk and then passed through the smoker before their descent into the fryer. They were the least greasy iterations I could recall, and three of us gobbled them like poultry popcorn.", "Above: Chicken skins; Left: Quail; Right: Shrimp and grits", "If the skins were definitive Husk, executed with such finesse under the watch of chef de cuisine Travis Grimes, then the rest of the meal framed the restaurant's evolving personality. Cornmeal-dusted catfish, bronzed in the spots where the fish laid flattest in the pan, sprawled over a mound of hoppin' John (smoky speckled beans with Carolina gold rice) and greens with their pot liquor. Apple and sage spoonbread was the stuffing for copper-skinned quail on a cushion of farro, butternut squash, and torn shards of mustard greens. A brothy take on shrimp and grits included peppers and onions braised in tomatoes (which still flourish well into the Lowcountry autumn), charred corn, and chorizo-like hunks of sausage. For dessert we polished off sweet potato chess pie surrounded by dollops of toasted marshmallow.", "Brock, like many other chefs of his generation, rightly believes that Southern food need not remain mired in a past of plantation feasts or grandmas' specialties \u2014 that the quality of the products could be a springboard toward fresh combinations and ideas. So he might take country ham and use it in a vinaigrette for a shrimp salad or serve pig's tails General Tso's style with spiced peanuts. Some entrees would always be straightforward, modern plates (say, a lusty pork chop with bacony field peas and kale), and a Southerner could always count on a familiar totem or two, like rich, crisp-edged cornbread or boiled peanuts.", "Sweet potato chess pie", "But I did love the more historical slant to this recent menu. Chefs often overlook the time-honored in favor of the novel, and it was gratifying to see what a skilled kitchen could do with homey and genteel dishes that so clearly evoked the region. Brock and his team approach the Husk menus like Buddhist sand mandalas: They build them and then wipe them away, starting anew the next day. Similar patterns may reappear, but the design is never quite the same. I know such a sharp gaze back in time isn't \u2014 nor should it be \u2014 permanent. I was glad to experience it as part of the repertoire, though.", "Brock left Nashville in 2006 to take the job as executive chef at McCrady's in Charleston, a title he still retains. The origins of McCrady's as a tavern stretch back to 1788, but Brock yanked the menu into the new millennium by weaving into multi-course menus things like shrimp stock gelled into sheets and olive oil frozen via liquid nitrogen. These days, the overt modernist fillips have largely disappeared. McCrady's remains a restaurant where Brock and chef de cuisine Daniel Heinze can interweave seasonal Lowcountry bounty with a global notion or two; Husk Charleston, by intention, is more focused in its Southern identity.", "The cooking at Husk Nashville synthesizes the whole of Brock's culinary personality. Without a McCrady's nearby, more complex aspects of his technical side winningly emerge. At a September dinner, fire-roasted gourds (yellow squashes, in this case) were arranged on a freckled ceramic plate with Malabar spinach, clumps of malted barley \"soil,\" and potent black walnuts in two variations: as scattered pieces and in an inky vinaigrette with sorghum. The collage pulled from the Southern larder sure enough, but it spun the flavors into a delicious, alternate universe. Same with catfish grilled over coals and then slathered with a puree of benne (the African strain of sesame that arrived in America during Colonial times), dotted with raw slices of pole beans and benne seeds, and set into a bath of warmed tomato juices bright with lime and house-made fish sauce.", "Left: Fire-roasted gourds with Malabar spinach and black walnuts; Right: Sean Brock; Below: Fried chicken", "While in South Carolina I'd say an order of skins is mandatory, the compulsory order here is probably the vegetable plate. It resembled an Indian thali, arriving on a round wooden platter holding five bowls. They contained symphonic harmonies of produce: hushpuppies studded with sweet peppers; a salad of shaved zucchini with compressed watermelon and tomatoes compressed in raspberry-red wine vinaigrette; grilled squash in chili-lime vinaigrette; and a succotash that included sweet corn, red peas, okra, and garlic chives. For a little protein, a 62-degree egg whose yolk seeped into grits and bay leaf oil.", "If I could only dine once more forever and ever at one Husk, I would have to head to Tennessee", "While dinner service flaunts the breadth of the kitchen's abilities, lunch is the only time you can get the fried chicken. Oh, this fried chicken. Brock has been tinkering with the recipes for years, and he would only make it as an occasional, unannounced treat in Charleston. Making it is a labyrinthine process that involves secret spices, but this much we know: The chicken slowly sizzles in bacon fat, chicken fat, rendered country ham, and butter. The true marvel? In Brock's hands, what sounds like overkill comes off as understated, with rippling crust and a deep, heightened flavor to the meat. This bird is truly the word.", "  ", "  ", "Burgers at Husk in Charleston (left) and Nashville (right)", "At both restaurants, the dining rooms sport handsomely worn hardwoods and wallpaper with silvery sunburst patterns.

NOLA's profusion of tourists, coupled with a populace that values leisure time more than most other places in the nation, make grand lunch service worth restaurants' efforts.

He was right. Not ten minutes after we arrived it was full in the soign\u00e9 downstairs dining room: ballroom-sized, lined with black and white tiles, replete with ceiling fans sprouting naked light bulbs, but still regal with its walls covered in green and gold fleur-de-lys print.

I prefer the Galatoire's version. This is not a contemporary take that tangles bivalves in gluey webs of cheese and crumbled bacon. Here, green magma covers the oysters. It often flows over the sides of the shells and then quickly darkens under the broiler. The color underneath remains a few shades brighter than the ink used to dye a wad of Benjamins. Anise shoots through the puree, underpinned by fennel and a shot of Herbsaint liqueur. The greens (at least spinach and parsley; perhaps watercress lurks as well) taste sharper than one would expect. Really, the oysters act as saline bonus bites rather than headliners. Ordering a side of Rockefeller greens separately is nearly as satisfying.", "The oysters kicked off a meal comprised strictly of classics. Another starter: the Galatoire Goute (pronounced goo-TAY), a combination plate of shrimp remoulade (coated in a tangy sauce that includes ketchup) and crabmeat maison (bound in Creole mustard aioli with capers, scallions, and lemon). An order of souffl\u00e9 potatoes, like puffy fries, arrived tepid; our server whisked them away with a nod and soon returned with a fresher batch. The flesh of fried trout prepared amandine style crackled against the teeth; a scattering of slivered almonds echoed the crunch. Brown butter and crabmeat heightened the sweetness of pompano, the restaurant's default fish special. I've been eating at Galatoire's since the 1990s but never had a meal impressed me more: There was a finer tuning to the preparations than in years past. We opted for a liquid dessert: The restaurant's famed caf\u00e9 br\u00fblot, coffee flamed with brandy and steeped with spices and citrus. The alcohol and caffeine somehow canceled each other out. Or so we told ourselves.", "Duck with root vegetables at Restaurant August", "Confession: I ate lunch at Galatoire's on a Thursday. The weekday crowd was spectacle enough, and past experiences have showed me that dining there the next day requires an even earlier arrival. On this visit I'd made a reservation for the Friday-only lunch at chef John Besh's flagship Restaurant August. Over the last decade Besh shifted into entrepreneurial mode \u2014 launching, among others, Italian charmer Domenica, seafood-focused Borgne, and Luke, a brasserie I favor for breakfast. August remains his grandest, most romantic venture. (The restaurant was named for its founder, August \"Duke\" Robin, who died in September.) In the front room, crown molding the color of caramel buttercream frame the windows. Umber hardwood floors hint of age: The Central Business District building was erected in the 1800s. It's a space that practically demands white linens on the tables.", "Besh and executive chef Todd Pulsinelli extend the quixotic tone to the cooking, which is au courant in its precision but also frequently timeless in its extravagance. A salad of pistachio crusted goat cheese and several variations of pear, glossed with honey-jalapeno vinaigrette, would assimilate on a fine-dining menu anywhere in the U.S. I fell hardest for the dishes with a Southern lilt, like fried green tomatoes on a bed of curried green tomato chow chow, heaped with creamy lobster salad. And Besh's signature, trout Pontchartrain \u2014 a hard-seared rectangle of fish napped in the kind of frankly rich cream sauce rarely seen in restaurants these days, offset by toothy mushrooms and lumps of crabmeat.

The boudin blanc \u2014 a white sausage made of rice and pork, including the liver that adds earthy silkiness \u2014 served at Cochon Butcher hearkens to Link's Southern Louisiana childhood. It is one of the city's indispensable dishes. The casual sibling to Link's Herbsaint, Cochon (around the corner), and newcomer Peche, Cochon Butcher started as a modest salumeria and sandwich shop in 2009. Soon it was a phenomenon, with lines frequently snaking out the door. In April it expanded from 30 seats to 120, and on a Saturday afternoon I still had to wait for a table. Don't let it deter: For visiting food lovers it should be the first lunchtime stop in New Orleans. (Yes, even before a po'boy shop.)

The boudin arrived hot and loamy as ever. House-cured meats and a frisky, not-too-salty olive salad elevated the muffuletta stacked on a fleecy sesame bun.

Over the music I eavesdropped while Yu chatted with customers who'd just had Gulf amberjack overlaid with sea moss embellished with a grating of dried blue runner fish and crowned with a lightly steamed lettuce leaf. \"I worry that it's too Chinese,\" he said. \"I don't want to be pigeonholed.\" Yu later told me he decided to keep it on the menu, which made me glad: The dishes with Asian intimations are always some of his strongest.", "Korean fried chicken with cole slaw and cornbread at Underbelly", "The same can be said for Chris Shepherd. Underbelly, where he is chef and co-owner, opened less than three years ago in the happening Montrose neighborhood but gained near-instant national fame for its menu approach: Shepherd looks to the city's many immigrant communities, and their mom-and-pop restaurants, for inspiration. On a given night, pork belly Thai curry might share table space with Greek meatballs with tzatziki, flatiron carne asada served with green chiles, and tilefish surrounded by Southern sides like field peas, greens, and cornbread. Dumpling-like Korean rice sticks napped in a kinetic sauce of gochujang (chile paste) and flossy goat meat remains a must-order staple.", "Honestly, not every dish is always flawless (a recent salad showcased pickled shrimp that were mealy), but the ideas and spirit behind the food usually win out. The night I was there the crowd included blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, and Middle Eastern families. It must be rewarding for Shepherd to look out into his dining room to see the faces that mirror his inclusive cooking.", "In recent years the Montrose area has become a culinary Ellis Island. In the same few blocks you'll find Blacksmith, a coffeehouse that serves an all-day breakfast of Vietnamese steak and eggs with toasted baguette and chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9; El Real, a Tex-Mex joint (housed in a former 1930s cinema with a beckoning Art Deco sign) serving righteous enchiladas and fajitas devised from historic recipes; and Indika, an upscale Indian gem run by Anita Jaisinghani, who also serves Indian thalis and cardamom-scented brioche bun for breakfast at Pondicheri in the hip Upper Kirby neighborhood.", "Left: Wood-fired pompano at Caracol; Right: Saffron saag paneer at Indika; Below: Caracol interior", "Indika came first, in 2002. I'm waiting for the day when more ambitious Indian restaurants specialize in specific regional cuisines. In the meanwhile, I'll happily sweep through the subcontinent via Jaisinghani's modern riffs. She deconstructs her saag paneer, filling a shallow bowl with a fresh-tasting combination of spinach and mustard greens, flavoring fresh cheese with saffron, adding a dollop of plum chutney, and finishing the dish with a crackery take on makki ki roti, a wheat and cornmeal flatbread that's popular in the Punjab. Earthy-sweet beet raita offsets tiny, pointy bitter melons stuffed with spiced paneer. Goat brains are all about texture, as delicate as softly scrambled eggs; amchur masala (a curry blend that includes piquant mango powder) delivers the flavor buzz.", "Mexico City native Hugo Ortega and his wife, Tracy Vaught, opened Hugo's in Montrose around the same that Indika launched. Serving dishes like octopus al carbon, tuna taquitos, and beef cheek in tingly, complex pasilla sauce, it became (beyond Rick Bayless' empire) one of the nation's few upscale Mexican restaurant success stories. Late last year, Ortega and Vaught brought to life Caracol, a bright room in the Galleria/Uptown area flaunting light woods and modern art and serving Mexican seafood specialties.", "The kitchen produces ceviches with disparate personalities. Petalos de Huachinango was the beauty pageant winner \u2014 snapper strewn over a rectangular platter with tangerine supremes and translucent ribbons of cucumber rolled like Chinese firecrackers. Ceviche Acapulque\u00f1o played the street-wise gamine with its mix of snapper, tomato, and onion feisty with Worcestershire sauce. (I preferred the latter.) Gulf oysters pulled from the wood-fired oven drifted in melted butter spiked with just enough chipotle. Wood-grilled pompano came with chunky pineapple, sliced radishes and red onions, and small lettuce leaves. The collage was somewhere between a salad and a salsa and its freshness only enhanced the fish's smoky virtues.", "Killen's barbecue five meat platter", "And speaking of smoke: I may largely gravitate toward Houston's accomplished global-minded restaurants, but for a true taste of Texas I couldn't leave without a thirty-minute trip to the town of Pearland and new Killen's Barbecue, recently awarded four stars by Houston Chronicle critic Alison Cook. Ronnie Killen runs heralded Killen's Steakhouse less than a mile away and spent years experimenting with woods and techniques to hone his command of barbecue. It paid off, as evidenced by the Friday lunch line flowing not just out the door but also down the sidewalk. Forty minutes later I was in a carnivorous trance. The brisket, peppery and precisely rendered, rivaled Aaron Franklin's in its sumptuous glory. The beef rib was almost indecent in its pink, custardy richness. Mustard seeds hid just under the sausage's pearly surface, providing extra pop. Pork, both crusty ribs and a tangled mass of pulled strands, showed near-equal splendor to the beef. Even the seasonal pumpkin bread pudding stood out, though I couldn't manage more than a couple of bites.", "Texas\u2019 coastal bend has its share of solid barbecue shacks, but none I\u2019ve tried before reach these heady heights.

It serves the country's most magnificent smoked meats. The whole hog-style 'cue served at Skylight Inn in Ayden, North Carolina and at Scott's BBQ in Hemingway, South Carolina, achieve near levels of transcendence in their own genres. Killen's Barbecue, a newcomer outside Houston in Pearland, Texas, is already running a close second. But Aaron Franklin's brisket is something else, an evolution that reset already towering standards in the Lone Star barbecue world.", "It isn't only that his brisket is so silken that, beyond the charred exterior, it has an almost pudding-like texture. Franklin's masterwork is also incredibly consistent. And the other meats \u2014 peppery pork ribs, hog meat pulled into dewy threads, turkey bathing in butter to counteract its leanness, beef and pork sausages that pop against the teeth \u2014 achieve similar levels of splendor. Dabs of calibrated, espresso-laced sauce is just gravy. Throw on sides of mustardy potato salad, meat-flecked pinto beans, and a slice of bourbon-banana pie to an already crowded tray and you have one of America's totemic lunches.", "Of course, there's the legendary, morning-long wait \u2014 the serpentine zigzag of bodies that stretches past the restaurant's porch and turquoise walls and onto its cracked parking lot. Arrive at 8 a.m. (on a weekday) if you want to be among the first served when the doors unlock at 11 a.m. Like the lines at Disney World, it is a cultural rite of passage. Strangers become acquaintances. People bring lawn chairs like they're claiming spots along a parade route. They hide from the sun under umbrellas. A staffer wanders down the row, quizzing customers on how much they're planning to order to glean an idea of when the day's meat will run out. A couple of years back, one could request an advance to-go order two days out to avoid the line, but that process now requires\u00a0about one month's planning.", "Settling in to the line at Franklin", " ", "Is it worth standing in the Franklin line at least once? Or once a year, even? Absolutely. But I also hear my Austin friend when she says, \"I don't want to have to take the morning off of work to eat amazing barbecue.\" Pre-Franklin, finding smoked meat divinity in Central Texas meant trekking to satellite towns for places like Kreuz Market in Lockhart, City Market in Luling, and Louie Mueller Barbecue in Taylor. Those exemplars remain destinations, but remarkable barbecue also flourishes in Austin proper these days \u2014 much of it served from permanently parked trailers. The greatest among these is probably La Barbecue, owned by LeAnn Mueller, granddaughter of Louie Mueller. John Lewis oversees the pit; he previously worked for Aaron Franklin. (Franklin bought his first pit from John Mueller, LeAnn's brother; he currently operates John Mueller Meat Co. Yes, the Austin barbecue lineage is small and inbred.) At lunch a line also stretches from La Barbecue's order window, though you can expect to stand for thirty minutes rather than the two to four hours at Franklin. Find a seat at one of the picnic tables sheltered under covered tents.", "Lewis' brisket reveals an especially crimson ring underneath its crusty, piquant bark. The fat is exquisitely rendered, the texture less crumbly than when I first tried it over a year ago. Velvety pulled pork, tinged with vinegar, reinforces how Texans have taken hold of the pig and now often smoke it with more finesse than counterparts in the Deep South. Cole slaw offers layers of heat from flakes of black pepper and jolts of chipotle in the mayo dressing.", "Above: Micklethwait; Left: Franklin; Right: La Barbecue", "La Barbecue's beef rib is righteous, but it sells out quickly. You stand a better chance of nabbing that Flinstonian cut at Micklethwait Craft Meats, a trailer that opened in East Austin in 2012. It receives plenty of attention but still smokes relatively low under the radar. Tom Micklethwait serves the expected meats but also breaks from tradition by concocting sausages made with goat or lamb and occasionally serving a gussied up take on Frito pie. I arrived around 1:15 p.m. on a weekday to find no line. The brisket skewed dry, but the beef rib was sumptuous, like eating pot roast cooked over a campfire. Potato salad, a few degrees from being mashed, was flecked with onion and bell pepper, and the cole slaw's light dressing crunched with poppy seeds. Micklethwait and his crew even bake loaves of fluffy white bread. Tempting carbs are dangerous when trying to consume as much protein as possible, but the effort nonetheless impressed.", "Seared shrimp with corn and okra at Barley Swine", "In Austin, it isn't just remarkable barbecue that emerges from doublewides. Bryce Gilmore is the most renowned example: He started Odd Duck Farm to Trailer in 2009, prepping meats and vegetables at the restaurant Jack Allen's Kitchen (run by his father, Jack Gilmore) and turning out smart creations like grilled romaine lettuce with goat's milk ricotta and poached egg or pulled duck over ciabatta. Booming success led Gilmore to open Barley Swine in December 2010, a tiny space with thick wooden beams, craggy stone walls, and an open kitchen. Pig trotters and pork belly shared the menu with grilled broccoli with fermented chile and duck egg or pasta filled with smoked fish and pureed potato. Servers knew as much about the far-flung beer list as they did about the food.", "", "A year ago, Barley Swine shifted to a $75 tasting menu format in anticipation of this year's resurrection of Odd Duck, now a brick-and-mortar owned by Bryce Gilmore, his brother Dylan, and chefs Mark Buley and Sam Hellman-Mass. I dined at both recently and found the cooking on equal footing. Which experience is more enjoyable depends on your format preferences. My meal at Odd Duck was buoyed by the giddiness of cooks who know they're grooving in a creative sweet spot. They took turns coming out of the kitchen to present their latest alchemies. Tender goat confit bathed in red chile starred in a wonderfully gloppy tower anchored by a gordita, scattered with popcorn, and sauced with thinned goat cheese. \"Pig face Cuban sandwich\" was forward in all the right ways \u2014 crisp, unctuous, mustardy. The kichen showed its (relative) demure side with lemony shrimp salad, nestled in Bibb lettuce leaves with fried potato and tangles of red onion. The nuttiness of mesquite bean ice cream elevated an already striking apple cake doughnut dripping with cider glaze.", "Cider also sparked the first bite of 15 courses at Barley Swine \u2014 a plump Gigamoto oyster glossed with the fermented apple juice blended with wasabi. It set the tone for the series of one- to three-bite dishes that comprised the meal. The cooks elegantly volleyed between compositions that evoked Texas and elsewhere. Texas: A corn muffin piled with velvety pork shoulder ham. Cured goat loin served like tartare and layered with eggplant, pine nuts, and minced rings of shishito pepper. One beautifully seared Gulf shrimp in a ceramic bowl over corn and sliced okra. Elsewhere: roasted chicken dumpling served on a spoon with sorghum vinegar. A gorgeous salmon chip with yogurt and smoked roe. And a strange rectangle of brioche spread with fig jam draped with a lobe of sea urchin. The restaurant nailed the beverage pairings by alternating between wines and beers: Spanish cava, Japanese red rice ale, Hungarian furmint (citrusy and sweet), Belgian ale. The ingredient combinations may occasionally surprise, but Barley Swine couldn't make a tasting menu experience any more accessible.", "Food at Odd Duck: Above: Goat confit in red chile with gordita; Left: Grilled okra with field peas and ricotta; Right: Apple doughnut with mesquite bean ice cream", "Paul Qui's seven-course menus, on the other hand, dangle diners just over the edge of comfort. Qui has long had an instinct for knowing when and how to prod palates into bolder frontiers. For eight years he worked with Tyson Cole at Uchi, the Japanese restaurant that put Austin on the culinary map as a city for more than barbecue. Cole made Qui at executive chef at Uchiko, the finer dining spinoff serving beauties like karaage with green apple and pickled watermelon rind that brought Qui a James Beard award for Best Southwestern Chef in 2012. (He also took the crown on Top Chef's ninth season that year.) Under a national spotlight, he opened his own restaurant, Qui, in East Austin last June. The white-walled renovated house looks like a modest affair from the exterior. Inside, the sweeping kitchen resembles a workshop, with more than a dozen staffers hustling behind the line at any given time.", "It was hard to be squeamish about pork blood when its primal funk melded so seamlessly with earthy maitake mushrooms and garlic.", "Qui's imagination circles the globe, and his menus (one omnivorous and the other dedicated to vegetables) rove with it. The first courses from a recent meal recalled Spain. Marcona almond gazpacho, one of the few standards in Qui's repertoire, provided a launching pad for gelee made from Pedro Ximenez sherry, fennel fronds, and foie gras terrine presented to resemble white chocolate shavings. On the vegetarian side, a duly compelling bowl of caramelized onion jus with another sherry gelee (this one made with nutty Amontillado), Valdeon cheese, and ciabatta croutons. Japanese influences came in the forms of yuzu caramel, ono (a Hawaiian fish) grilled over Binchotan coals, and the attuned ponzu that brightened mackerel crudo.", "But the most exhilarating dishes drew on Qui's Filipino heritage. It was hard to be squeamish about pork blood when its primal funk melded so seamlessly with earthy maitake mushrooms and garlic. Peanut curry with green beans and puffed rice satisfied with its direct flavors. And a separate patio menu pulled from the Filipino lexicon in clever ways: I loved the pork and shrimp lumpia, a Southeast Asian spring roll, presented unfolded like a taco. Even a cheddar cheese ice cream sandwich, which sounds like wackiness culled from a grocery store's frozen food aisle, was inspired by the frozen cheese treats Qui snacked on as a child in the Philippines. Qui uses clothbound cheddar from Vermont's Cabot Creamery to make the confection, and he gilds it with goat's milk cajeta.

He helped sire Southwestern cuisine during his 21-year tenure as the executive chef at the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek, and in 2007 he built his self-named home base in the Ritz-Carlton Dallas. Fearing's is one of the country's most spectacular dining spaces. Enter through the Rattlesnake Bar, framed by mahogany and backlit honey onyx that casts an almost sci-fi glow, like you could reach through it into a parallel universe.", " ", "Rattlesnake Bar; Sendero Room", "The actual restaurant features four areas (all serving the same menu) with entirely distinct personalities. Mansion habitu\u00e9s favor the formal Gallery, with its hardwoods and rugs and soothing shades of bamboo. The Sendero is airy and genteel, featuring a shimmery Murano chandelier and non-tacky wicker furniture. A patio arranged among blue-tiled fountains particularly beckons during the fall months. Dean's Kitchen is the most casual and the buzziest; it's where hostesses often seat first-timers.", "Over the years, I've sometimes been more taken with the surroundings than the food. Fearing adheres to the more-is-more plating aesthetic, and his entrees (say, for example, halibut coated in barbecue spices with succotash, crabmeat, Tabasco-bacon gastrique, and fried okra) can be astonishing or overbearing, depending on how cohesively the myriad ingredients unify. And misses don't sit well when mains cost between $44 and $58.", " ", "Beef enchiladas", "That said, I've never enjoyed Fearing's more than at a recent brunch. Daylight meals are still no giveaway. A three-course meal clocks in at $38; individual starters cost $12 and entrees $24. But the meal framed the chef's particular genius for framing high-low Texas flavors. Beef enchiladas possessed all the cheesy-crispy charisma of versions served at Tex-Mex joints across the state, except the spices in the chili gravy was more finely tuned (the amount of cumin exactly right) and a decorative squiggle of cilantro cream smoothed the heat. An appetizer of two fish tacos, so large they could easily sate a smaller appetite, came piled with glossy slaw and crumbled cotija queso. The layers of crunch came together marvelously. A vegetarian combo platter included fried avocado and a lush spinach taco. Fearing's signature tortilla soup \u2014 a piquant, tomato-laced broth poured into a bowl filled with smoked chicken breast and other garnishes that evoke the region \u2014 fit neatly into this m\u00e9lange.", "The breezy mood of Dean's Kitchen, with cooks and stoves in full view and the light oak paneling extra cheerful on a sunny Sunday afternoon, was as enticing as ever. It was the food, though, that delivered the most satisfying sense of place.", "For years Dallas was known (rightly, by my experiences) as barbecue hinterlands. Transcendent brisket required a drive to central Texas. That changed in 2010, when\u00a0Justin and Diane Fourton launched Pecan Lodge, which began as a stall in the Dallas Farmers Market. In a pit named Lurlene, Justin mastered smoking brisket over mesquite until the meat and fat melded into a lush mass, the exterior blackened to come-hither bark. Media attention gained momentum, and by 2012 there were weekend lines snaking the length of the building. Last year, Texas Monthly named it the second best barbecue in the state. Dallas 'cue had caught fire at last.", "Beef brisket and pulled pork", "A change in the public market ownership forced the Fourtons to relocate: They reopened six months ago in the Deep Ellum neighborhood near downtown, in a freestanding building large enough to keep the crowds moving quickly. Having scarfed down the brisket at the previous location, I found the version here (which is now smoked over hickory and oak, no more mesquite) equally superb, and maybe more so. Few barbecue restaurants can achieve and maintain the status in which the nubbly beef maintains a near-molten texture. It is the must-have meat. Taut pork ribs come in a close second.", "Pecan Lodge serves more Southern-leaning sides than the standard beans and slaw in most Texas joints. Mac-n-cheese sprinkled with bacon and porky collards insinuate the pig into cow-country traditions. The kitchen also produces wholly respectable fried chicken, though it should only be considered a protein addendum to the star attraction.", "Nothing about Matt McCallister's food hews to Texas traditions, and it keeps his dining room full. McCallister previously worked for Lone Star stalwart Stephan Pyles but launched his own restaurant cooking with a modernist slant not before seen in Dallas. Powders and foams at first embellished plates. Two years in, though, McCallister now takes his most winning cues from New Nordic aesthetics. The closest item to a straight-up steak is wagyu medallions (cut from the rib blade) cooked sous vide for three days and arranged around hay sabayon with curly endive and p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux potatoes. Slivers of trout, rolled and poached, perch at the edge of a bowl among nasturtium leaves and sheets of the fish's crisped skin. In the center is a well of buttermilk sprinkled with dill. Smoked trout roe warms the flavors.", "If McCallister's food possesses an edge that deviates from the typical North Texas restaurant, much of it is still broadly accessible. Burrata, mint, and sunflower sprouts liven up the ubiquitous beet salad. He uses tagliardi, a rectangular pasta, to ensnare rich Bolognese. Fun variations like house-made lambs tongue pastrami and chorizo made with goat give the handsome charcuterie board an inventive jolt. (It also includes more familiar salumis and prosciutto for the less adventurous.) A frisky dessert has peanuts, gentle curry, and coconut milk dancing around a milk chocolate cake.", "Above: Charcuterie platter; Left: Wagyu beef with hay sabayon; Right: Milk chocolate cake with peanuts and curry", "It's heartening to see such a progressive restaurant thriving in Dallas, though the restaurant was so busy on a weekday evening last month that the hospitality faltered at meal's end.

We paid our check (over $500 with tip) and had lingered not five minutes when general manager Jeff Gregory leaned over and asked us if we might move to the bar to free up our table.

Tesar wades beyond the fray with a pan-carnivorous approach. Bacon receives abundant love on this menu: It gilds bone marrow (with celery leaves and caviar providing much-needed contrast), it comes in pork belly forms in the Changian steamed bun as well as over collards for a Southern lilt, and it stars in its own over-the-top tasting with five variations, including crisped Iberico ham.

I lived in Dallas when he opened Tei-An in 2008; I consider him one of the country's outstanding and\u00a0\u2014 outside the city \u2014 largely unsung Japanese chefs. A native of Tokyo, Sakurai brought Dallas its first true-minded sushi bar with Teppo in 1995, and soon after introduced Japanese-style grilling (not the Americanized clowning where cooks juggle knives) at Tei Tei Robata Bar.", " ", "Some Japanese chefs famously devote their career to perfecting one dish or genre. Sakurai's driving curiosity spurred him last decade to sell both businesses to employees and devote himself to soba, a famously querulous dough (with its ratio of eighty-percent buckwheat and twenty-percent wheat) to form and cut. In preparation for launching Tei An, one of the anchors in the One Arts District complex near downtown, Sakurai returned briefly to his hometown to study at the Tsukiji Soba Academy. In keeping with the ritual around eating soba, he designed a sanctuary of a restaurant: calm lines, grainy woods, and a rock garden with a trickling fountain in the center of the prominent soba bar. (A window behind the bar looks into the room where Sakurai makes the noodles.) A separate bar area in the front caters to a rowdier crowd.", "Above: Sanma mackerel; Left: Crab and uni risotto; Right: Caviar nigiri", "Not that one shouldn't be imbibing. Sakurai gave an instructive quote when I wrote about Tei An for the Dallas Morning News: \"When I was young, my grandfather told me over and over, \u2018Teiichi, never drink sake at a sushi bar. Sake is for drinking at soba houses. Drink sake and enjoy appetizers first, and then, at the very end of the meal, enjoy the soba.'\" Heed grandpa's words. There are sakes here that meet every budget and taste, and the staff, many of whom have been with Sakurai since the restaurant opened, are skilled guides.", "In the six years since Tei An launched, its menu has grown three-fold to accommodate diverse tastes. Look for the purest expressions of Japanese cooking, like a salad of fluttery white seaweed, cucumbers, and carrots dressed in white vinegar, or cubes of silky-crisp tofu coated in buckwheat flour and deep-fried. Specials might include smoked salmon collar or a buckwheat version of okonomiyaki, a pancake filled with vegetables and seafood. The specials also wade into Sakurai's cross-cultural whimsies, like caviar nigiri or crab and uni risotto served in the crab's hollow shell. Though I prefer the more strictly Japanese dishes, these adjuncts are undeniably delicious.", "I'm definitely less inclined toward the soba variations sauced in riffs on carbonara or Bolognese. Sakurai views them as gateway pleasures for the uninitiated. My hope is that diners will come to appreciate the soba in its sublime purity, paired with dipping sauces like black sesame or matched with greaseless tempura for stouter appetites.", "To best understand Sakurai's mastery, call ahead to request the seven-course, $100 omakase, built around a gamut of techniques. My recent meal began with sashimi and then custardy, saffron-hued egg, steamed with dashi, returned to its shell, and topped with one sliver of musky black truffle. Next, two exquisite seasonal treats: tempura of woodsy matsutake mushrooms, which grow wild around white or red pines in Japan. They sat in a crackly cluster alongside a small bowl of gohan, rice flavored with the matsutakes. Now something grilled: sanma mackerel. Sakurai appeared from the kitchen to tell us how these fish swim down from northern Japan in the fall and are caught off the waters of the central Chiba prefecture. If the fish swim too far south, Sakurai said, they lose too much fat and aren't as luscious.", "Soba and tempura", "Before the ice sculpture soba finale, there was one more delicacy: A5 wagyu beef, from the Miyazaki prefecture along the southeastern coast of Kyushu island, so marbled in even patterns of pink meat and white fat that it looked more like a dress print than dinner. A staffer seared a few slices for each for us on a hot stone. After the soba there was a gentle denouement with dorayaki, a spongy pancake filled with sweetened red bean paste. I felt deeply and precisely sated.", "Now that I've enumerated Tei-An's singular qualities, it's probably time to mention that the place also serves what many regard as the finest bowl of tonkotsu ramen in Dallas \u2014 the broth textbook milky, the chashu pork sweet, saline, and limpid. Also: Sakurai is opening a ramen bar called Ten in early 2015. It'll be a smash, no doubt. But when the ramen carousers need repose, the temple of soba will be waiting.", "Restaurant Editor Bill Addison is traveling to chronicle what's happening in America's dining scene and to formulate his list of the essential 38 restaurants in America.

Once the home of a cotton tycoon, the Italian Renaissance-style property welcomed the public in 1980 and directly established itself as a playground for socialites and billionaires at a time when the city was drenched in oil money. The reputation cemented. Even at a time when fine dining is downscaling (and Dallas' trend toward casual took root later than in most cities) the Mansion remains synonymous with occasion and indulgence.", "Much of that has to do with the restaurant's reputation for doting service (particularly enjoyed by regulars) and with the three unusually gifted chefs who led the kitchen over the last thirty years. Dean Fearing came on as executive chef in 1984, catapulting the restaurant's fame. He worked the dining room in his chef's whites and cowboy boots while pushing forward the era's Southwestern cuisine craze with luxurious tortilla soup and lobster tacos. He stayed for 21 years, sometimes veering into rococo fusion flings (imagine fried quail surrounded by pot stickers, egg salad, and gingered rice salad) before leaving in 2006 to open Fearing's, with its four stunning themed rooms, in the Ritz-Carlton Dallas.", "A quest to replace Fearing brought outspoken chef John Tesar to the city. He expelled the Southwestern shtick in favor of broader New American extravagances. I gave his cooking five stars during my tenure as dining critic at the Dallas Morning News: I still daydream about a lobe of foie gras impaled with a vanilla bean, its tiny black seeds trailing off into an apple puree underneath. Tesar moved on in early 2009 (he currently operates two Dallas restaurants, Spoon and Knife); Bruno Davaillon, previously at Alain Ducasse's Mix at the Hotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, replaced him nine months later. Davaillon hails from the Touraine area of France's Loire Valley. He isn't an extrovert like his predecessors and stays close to the stoves. But he has the same degree of virtuoso talent.", "Cauliflower panna cotta with caviar and daikon gelee", "The Mansion has strived to remain relevant to changing tastes: a multimillion-dollar renovation last decade toned down the space's formality with modern art and slick leather chairs. Servers once wore tuxedoes through the day; now they wear khakis at lunch and black at dinner. I understand the urge to reach a larger audience, but I come to a place like the Mansion expecting to bask in throwback grandeur. The kitchen offers an a la carte menu, but when most appetizers are priced over $20 and mains cost $38 to $59, you might as well go for one of four five-course tasting menus themed to vegetables ($85), seafood ($95), and meat ($105), or the \"gourmand\" ($115) that covers the protein gamut. The staff might even nudge the kitchen to mix and match dishes from different menus on the diners' behalf.", "My first meal at the Mansion since I left Dallas (and my first time trying Davaillon's creations) began with a Belon oyster, its shell also filled with chopped Texas wagyu tartare, smoked cream, lemon zest, and a shower of crunchy red quinoa. It mixed French and Lone Star State aesthetics and hinted at the exotic. It telegraphed Davaillon's headspace as a chef: His imagination meanders but his technique is classical and micro-detailed. The sculptured courses that came next traveled the world of flavors, but the kitchen's precision gave the meal a cohesive arch. Dashi broth and gelee, cubed daikon, and a sprinkling of buckwheat offset the richness of cauliflower panna cotta and caviar. Pastrami, wilted Savoy cabbage, mustard cream airlifted hunks of supple monkfish to Bucharest. Cilantro-crusted lamb evoked North Africa, with its sides of merguez (cleverly stuffed and braised in a cylinder made of kohlrabi) and minted yogurt.", "Above: Belon oyster with wagyu tartare, smoked cream, and red quinoa; Left: Cilantro-crusted lamb with merguez, kohlrabi, and minted yogurt; Right: Hibiscus-poached apple with lemon pound cake and apple sorbet", "Straight-up modern American pleasures landed on the table as well: a silky sweetbread raviolo over autumnal chestnut puree; an equally seasonal stunner from pastry chef Nicolas Blouin of apple spheres poached in hibiscus syrup (at first glance they resembled raspberries) with lemon pound cake, almond granola, and bracing green apple sorbet crowned a pretty apple chip. It was one of those dinners where trust in the chef's gifts instantly took hold, where my friend and I simply relaxed into the experience. I had to hunt for criticisms. There was really only one: the curry in a piquillo pepper marmalade came on too strong alongside delicate king crab meat wrapped in avocado cannelloni-style.", "Servers may be more casually dressed but they remain as pampering as ever. In their knowledge of the cooking, one can sense unusually strong communication between the kitchen and the dining room. Newly arrived sommelier Jennifer Eby, whose ebullience will fit right in with the staff, poured elegant French whites throughout the evening.

Cooks plant themselves in front of the thermal blast, basting grass-fed Uruguayan beef ribeye, robust skirt steak, supple beef short ribs, and lamb shoulder chops with seasoned meat drippings. To sample of the full measure of the grill's power, share the Asado Argentino for two or more. It includes short rib, skirt steak, and chorizo but also throws in sweetbreads, grilled so the exteriors are golden with char but the interior remains creamy, and a version of blood sausage made to convert the doubters: The addition of grown walnuts along with rice ameliorates the pudding-like texture that can be unsettling, and nutmeg and cumin infuse it with flavor at once familiar and exotic.", "Above: Asado Argentino; Left: Clam chowder with smoked bone marrow; Right: Braised tripe with octopus and mint aioli", "One can start with a shareable spread of seafood preparations (shrimp ceviche, Dungeness crab, octopus poke), but this is really a place to reach beyond variations on classic chophouse tropes.

True to form, the \"Pigeon noodles\" improbably wowed: The strawberries and turnips merged into a brain-jangling chutney that mellowed the fruit's sour-sweetness and vegetable's grassy-earthiness. Black pepper and scallions helped push the flavors in a savory direction. Parmesan smoothed the flavors.

A velvety saffron sauce worked crowd hypnosis over sashimi-grade fluke, cantaloupe, and avocado, drawing them together with its enigmatic perfume. The French classic sole Veronique received an autumnal makeover, with snowy medallions of steamed fish surrounded by herbed brown butter and punctuated by black-skinned Venus grapes and dots of celery root puree. Chicken rubbed with a peppery Montreal smoked meat spice blend was draped over oxtail meat, semolina gnocchi formed into a rectangle and fried, and a few green beans. The kicker on this entree? A gloss of melted taleggio, which gave the whole thing a wacky, retro-fun vibe that recalled 1990s experimentations.", "Le Pigeon is a snug restaurant, and the tone of the food encourages communication between tables (though the best seats in the house are at the bar built around the open kitchen). The couple next to us noticed our baroque foie gras appetizer \u2014 two lobes of terrine spiced with vadouvan curry decorated with drizzles of marjoram honey and \"ratatouille escabeche\" (vegetables like zucchini and eggplant cooked and then pickled) \u2014 and requested their own.

Half the parties in the restaurant seemed to have ordered the restaurant's other trademark, beef cheek Bourguignon over sour cream and chive mashed potatoes. (The dish leaned salty.)

Its freshness and exacting assembly hoisted it above standard bridge club fare.", "The food's lightness leaves plenty of mental and physical space for dessert.

As the cost of beef has turned ribeyes and strips, long a semi-affordable culinary luxury, into a veritable financial hardship, I\u2019ve argued that rough-around-the-edges steakhouses will need to do a bit more to justify $100 plus per person tabs. Puck, accordingly, breaks out the decanters for even cheaper bottles of wine. A single order of chestnut soup is split into three separate bowls. The sound levels and space between tables are closer to a venue like Gabriel Kreuther than, say, Keens.

It is a prima facie American indulgence. A steak dinner is never quite affordable, but it\u2019s always approachable, a guaranteed way to spend about as much as you would on a tasting menu but with a third of the courses, none of the tableside speeches, and in half the time.

He doesn\u2019t. Almost every steak here is a study in the same degree of blandness. The steaks lack aromas of beefiness as much as they lack stronger overtones of stilton or offal. They are the bovine equivalents of chicken breast. The only noticeable difference between a dry-aged strip and a wet-aged ribeye is the price tag, and that the latter has more moisture.

It does not have table service because, well, there are no tables, nor are there seats. The ceiling is painted mustard yellow (French's, not dijon, topped with doodles of break-dancing salte\u00f1as), and the restaurant's official mascot, which hangs on the wall, is a llama mask that's somehow a dead ringer for the evil rabbit in Donnie Darko. Cayenne-spiked fries and a brisket-heart hamburger laced with oregano and smoked salt were the stars at the Oropeza brothers' seasonal locations, but not at BLP, so I won't tease you with them. At BLP, you'll have to make do with the chola sandwich, but this is not a bad thing.", "BLP's chola, a reinterpretation of the classic Bolivian pork sandwich, is a swine three way: musky braised shoulder with burnt ends, house cured bacon deeply perfumed with smoke, and sticky chicharron softened by the warmth of all the other ingredients. The sandwich, laced with garlicky mayo (to amplify the richness) and pickled carrots (to cut through the same), packs all the porcine grandeur of Momofuku Ss\u00e4m\u00a0Bar's $250 bo\u00a0ss\u00e4m\u00a0into a hand-held, $12 package. A brisket sandwich, with the same accoutrements, boasts none of the promised smoke flavor, which is just as well as the dish is rather a study in the concentrated flavor of beef. Eating this salty masterpiece is akin to dining on a short rib sandwich slathered in pan drippings.", "It's easy to dismiss BLP as yet another fast casual venue peddling quinoa salad. But that grain makes sense here \u2014 the caviar of the starch world (such cute little spheres), is a chief export of Bolivia. The dark story behind the stuff, of course, is that the worldwide demand for the high-protein, grain-like seed has driven monocropping throughout the Andes, and demand-driven price increases abroad have made the traditional foodstuff unaffordable to many Bolivianos. With that in mind, you can skip BLP's quinoa salad, with its mix of greens, cherries, and walnuts. Quinoa nachos, drizzled with spicy homemade cheese sauce, don't pack half the sweet, sundrenched flavor of the superior corn-chip variety; they're also more expensive. An order with a scoop of pork costs $14 before tax.", "But you can't avoid quinoa entirely: It makes an appearance in the majestic vegetarian salte\u00f1a, whose pastry shell holds an incendiary stew of smoky-spicy aji panka, funky oyster mushrooms, and yes, soft quinoa.

He constructed the restaurant on a cliff overlooking Lake Union; the building's jaunty angles mirror juts of land across the watery expanse. The view is remarkable even on a drizzly evening, when the city lights in the distance create a twinkly haze through the mist. Stone columns, cedar beams, and discrete fixtures that filter down marigold light give the room ageless warmth. Canlis is still, hands down, one of America's most romantic destinations.", "The service matches the atmosphere. A hostess showed my friend and me to a table right in front of the picture windows. My first thought was, \"How did we score this?\" (And, no, it wasn't because I was made as a critic; I'm quite sure I escaped notice.) But nearly every party in the restaurant enjoyed an exquisite sightline. Couples sat side-by-side against a nearby banquet and on the tier above us, facing out toward the spectacle. Our server was the model of a modern fine-dining professional: doting but not obsequious, patient when we took too long to decide on cocktails, smooth and accurate with every question about the food we lobbed at her.", "Our meal, like the ambience, had a certain timelessness\u2014and the cooking that attempted to look forward faltered. Last decade, brothers Brian and Mark Canlis began taking over day-to-day operations from their parents, Chris and Alice, who ran the business after patriarch Peter Canlis passed away in 1977. The siblings brought aboard Jason Franey as executive chef in 2008. Franey worked as Daniel Humm's sous chef at Manhattan's Eleven Madison Park, and the Canlises intended him to push the menu in more progressive directions. But it's always dicey to mess with a formula rooted in multigenerational traditions.", "Photo provided by Canlis", " ", "Dinner skewed tame. We had the choice of ordering three- or four-course meals with options in every category (starters, entrees, desserts), or a set seven-course chef's tasting menu that required both of us to order it. In hindsight, the tasting menu\u2014with dishes that night like matsutake mushrooms with chicken liver mousse, Sauternes, and purslane\u2014would have likely delivered more modernism. The regular menu read docile and familiar: heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella, watermelon, and arugula; butternut squash with brown butter and sage; lamb with potato r\u00f6sti and carrots. Continental classics filled out the offerings, and I have a soft spot for well-executed vintage dishes, so we largely charged ahead on that path.", "Our server trundled over a cart to prepare a salad tableside: She tossed romaine in a wooden bowl with bacon, cherry tomatoes, scallions, and grated cheese in a lemony olive oil-egg dressing. Fresh mint added a distinctive glint to this Americana charmer. Prawns splayed in a tidy row were dappled with a sauce of vermouth, lime, and a whisper of garlic. Wagyu New York strip delivered plenty of char and sanguine savor. We ordered its faithful chophouse companion alongside: twice-baked mashed potatoes, fluffy with sour cream and riddled with more bacon. This was Continental without the theatrical frisson\u00a0of a place like La Grenouille, but it was a spread that my four-year-old nephew or my 88-year-old grandmother would equally appreciate. At a standard-bearer for celebrations, approachability counts.", "The benchmarks impressed more than two modish savories: overcooked halibut in a wan tomato fondue and pork cheek lolling in a tangy, one-note corn puree. Given the broad appeal, would it be out of place for at least a couple of dishes on the basic menu to surprise the more jaded palates among the clientele? Would it be too outr\u00e9 for the kitchen to explore a recipe or two that harkens to the Canlis family's Greek heritage?", "Dessert sparked the meal's most striking pyrotechnics. The pastry team, led by Baruch Ellsworth, furnished a billowy Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9, textbook down to the cr\u00e8me anglaise on the side. But a reimagined mille-feuille also brought the wow factor: It was more akin to a candy bar with creamy layers of vanilla, milk chocolate, and banana, surrounded by fillips like crumbled cookie and roasted banana ice cream.

Back then, Batali and Bastianich were the top players in Manhattan\u2019s white-hot Italian renaissance, and their newest establishment, Del Posto, would go on to become one of the city\u2019s most heralded culinary establishments.", "But in the decade that followed, things changed. Batali and Bastianich had brought New York into the era of regional Italian fare, but the evolution kept going: from the haute red saucery of Carbone, to the quirky \"Cheesus Christ\" pizzas of Roberta\u2019s, to the wood-fired lamb steaks of Lilia. The landscape has evolved, which makes the question of La Sirena, the latest Batali/Bastianich endeavor, a fascinating one. Can two of the city\u2019s great Italian restaurateurs return to the forefront and wow us with a Tao-sized Italianate hangout, conveniently located directly above the actual Tao?", "To be brief: They do not wow us. Del Posto was one of the most important restaurant openings of its era, but La Sirena is just another newcomer, another Italian restaurant that happens to serve a hamburger.", "But the good news is that it\u2019s a nice enough place to drink a daytime martini and pick at a plate of excellent rigatoni carbonara while watching all the pretty people on an al fresco terrace that alone is more than twice the square footage of most New York restaurants. Who are we to protest the pleasure of that? Tao, after all, isn\u2019t open for brunch.", "La Sirena is just another newcomer, another Italian restaurant that happens to serve a hamburger.", "Like its downstairs neighbor, La Sirena is located in the Maritime Hotel. There are plenty of ambitious hotel restaurants in New York, but La Sirena isn\u2019t trying to be one of them. In case there\u2019s any doubt about the gravitational forces exerted by Mario Batali, the lower Chelsea/upper Meatpacking neighborhood, or the Maritime Hotel itself, let me clear things up: At any given night at La Sirena, a restaurant spanning the length of a full city block, with 210 indoor seats and a hundred more outdoors, the whole place is packed. Patrons dress as if they\u2019re going clubbing after they finish their sugar-dusted bomboloni (made by former Le Bernardin pastry chef Michael Laiskonis), clad in leather pants, leather jackets, leather dresses with leather epaulettes, and see-through blouses.", "This crowd is primed for $23 vodka cocktails, and they\u2019re readily available. A bartender mixes Absolut Elyx (\"the world\u2019s first true luxury vodka\"), with sloeberry gin, cocchi Americano, and dry cider, and pours it into an ornamental copper pineapple that you can, if you\u2019d like to recreate the experience at home, purchase for $98 on the Elyx website. You pick it up with a firm grip, because the entire concoction feels as if it weighs six pounds, and you sip, via a metal straw, a liquid that evokes the sensation of putting your face over an alcohol-filled humidifier. The drink is a triumph for vodka as a neutral spirit, but a failure as a cocktail that will cost more than most late-night cab rides. I sampled it alongside an inconsistently butchered short rib carpaccio that, depending on the bite, exhibited the texture of perfect raw beef or of dry-aged Saran Wrap.", "At La Sirena, which boasts a sweepingly curvilinear midcentury aesthetic, the soundtrack runs to the nondescript club bangers you might encounter at spin class, and the menu resembles that of a run-of-the-mill trattoria. Your cavatelli with pork ribs (blubbery and undercooked) or your linguine with clam sauce (microwave-quality) are both served tableside, a dramatic flourish that does nothing to improve the actual dishes themselves; the pastas are simply scooped out of a pan and dropped on a plate. We\u2019re forced to watch as the servers dazzle everyone with their Vegas buffet tong skills.", "Fried soft shell crabs with ramps serve as a phoned-in curtsey to the season, while a dish of baked clams, generally a way to intensify the mollusks\u2019 tang through heat and butter, acts as a study in how to camouflage bland shellfish under too many bread crumbs. A server sternly warns the table about the intensely briny punch of a bottarga-topped plate of artichoke hearts, but his dehortations are for naught: The dish turns out to be as insipid as banquet-hall green salad.", "Top: burger and braciole. Bottom: amatriciana ravioli.", "Fettuccine verde is neither overcooked enough to be mushy nor undercooked to be al dente; it simply a caloric conduit for crumbly sausage bolognese. Better is the amatriciana ravioli, little dumplings of sweet tomato sauce and guanciale \u2014 they\u2019re topped with verdant scallions, a nod to the Roman dish\u2019s traditional onions. There\u2019s the creative Batali that we know. The kitchen slathers caserecce pasta (a cousin to fusilli) with a gossamer coating of broccoli rabe pesto, chiles, and sesame, imparting the noodles with an assertively nutty and exhilaratingly bitter finish. And spicy octopus bucatini is an elegant essay in heat, tomato sauce, and soft cephalopod flesh.", "Desserts, at the hands of pastry chef Laiskonis, are the only real showstoppers here.", "Mains are about what one might expect from any restaurant anywhere in the city: meatballs over kale, chicken topped with peppers, sea bream with crispy skin. Just be sure to avoid the under-rendered duck breast with a carrot sauce that has all the complexity of Gerber baby food. And the brunch burger is an easy contender for one of the city\u2019s lousiest new dishes. While Shake Shack sells a double patty stack with a gorgeous griddle char for $8.75, La Sirena uses onions, a potato roll, and mozzarella to mask two grey pucks that that have seen less salt than a communion wafer, served with under-crisped fries. Cost: $21.", "Desserts, at the hands of pastry chef Laiskonis, are the only real showstoppers here, from the soft baba with its gently bitter Campari infusion, to the pignoli tart with its pecan pie-like texture, to the $19 brunch pastry basket with its collection of buttery kouign ammans and cloudlike cheddar biscuits.", "Bastianich and Batali have always been shrewd with their branding choices. Lupa is widely recognized as one of New York\u2019s finest Roman restaurants. Casa Mono is one of the city\u2019s few Michelin-starred Spanish spots. Otto is a reliable place for inexpensive pastas and pizzas. And then there are the twin jewels of the duo\u2019s New York empire: Babbo and Del Posto. In the timeline of New York restaurants, Babbo is an essential precursor to restaurants like Momofuku and the Spotted Pig, serving up some of the city\u2019s most iconic and creative pastas, at relatively accessible prices, to a soundtrack of Eminem and Led Zeppelin. In his 2004 review of the restaurant, then-New York Times critic Frank Bruni cited Babbo\u2019s choice of music (and the volume at which it was blasted) as a reason for withholding a fourth star from the venue. But the music never changed \u2014 and the crowds never subsided. Del Posto, in contrast, does not play Eminem. It boasts a grand piano, a grand marble staircase, and refined presentations available only as set menus.", "Torta della nonna, salami cart.", "The ovular blue-and-white pattern of La Sirena\u2019s terrazzo marble floors is repeated on the tableware, part of an overall aesthetic that extends to the outdoor patio and even the iPad wine lists, specially designed to harmonize with the restaurant\u2019s elegant motif. It\u2019s too bad that brief nod to technology doesn\u2019t extend to waiter-free drone ordering: Getting a drink when you\u2019re seated at a table can require as much strategic patience as jockeying for a gin &amp; tonic at McFadden\u2019s during happy hour. Vespers and fennel margaritas (both of which are excellent) never seem to arrive until you\u2019re three-quarters of the way finished with whatever you wanted to nibble on as you sipped them.Service as a whole ranged from passable to terrible during my visits; in this regard, La Sirena serves as an unwitting social experiment in how poorly New York diners will allow themselves to be treated in exchange for a seat at at a decked-out space run by a celebrity chef in a hip part of town. I watched a patron carry three cocktails as he walked from the bar to the lounge, a difficult task because most humans only have two hands; he passed by three waiters, none of whom offered any assistance. I almost walked out one night when, after being seated just after 10 p.m., a server didn\u2019t ask what we wanted to order until nearly 10:30 p.m. On a Saturday at brunch time, I watched a waiter squirt green juice into shot glasses from a drippy squeeze bottle and deliver it as an amuse to every table but mine.", "Of course, not every restaurant has to be Del Posto or Babbo. But coming from Batali, a restaurant has to be better than this.

I couldn\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019s because he recognized me, or because the staff is more on point when he\u2019s in the house, but I do know that on other evenings, I was entirely invisible to the salami man.", "I\u2019m a regular at the bar at the majestic Del Posto, where I happily part with $100 for a plate or two of pasta and a few cocktails.

Slivers of smoked trout stood their ground under a thick, candy-red crown of pickled onion and over a rich mound of lentils, walnuts, and onions enrobed in cr\u00e8me fraiche. Curls of fried salmon belly looked sculptural and tasted unusually lush, snarled among sharp purslane and juicy nectarine slices; cauliflower puree added earthiness.", "Servers took orders and delivered dishes with mechanized precision. They weren't cold, and they didn't rush my friend and me, but the staff obviously understands that maintaining an allegro tempo is crucial to the restaurant's rhythm. This is an oyster bar for modern lives.

The shift in emphasis innately slows the cadence: The Whale Wins, unlike The Walrus and the Carpenter, takes a smattering of reservations nightly, and customers tend to hunker down for a fuller, more leisurely meal. Servers here don't keep the pace quite so synchronized. And the restaurant, in Seattle's community-minded Wallingford neighborhood, has a European airiness. The tables sit close together but lofty ceilings (hung with letter-shaped light fixtures that spell out HELLO HELLO), cottage-white walls, and the open hearth create a lavish sense of spaciousness.", " ", "Roasted clams in white wine broth", " ", "Small plates still dominate, though there are exceptions like a roasted half-chicken or a cote de boeuf for two for $62\u2014two examples that also highlight how far the menu can stray from the shoreline. More to the point, Erickson and her crew take the Walrus's culinary aesthetic and push the ideas further here: Dishes are saucier, riskier, and the flavors zigzag more sharply. Whiffs of smokiness clung to a generous bowl of roasted clams on my visit. Corn, onion, and butter sweetened their white wine broth, with shiso lending its minty mystery. Dill was strewn atop like seaweed washed ashore. A shimmery eggplant puree cushioned a fetching hill of beans\u2014chickpeas, white beans, and pole beans, with corn adding texture and a dusting of parmesan to animate the earthy flavors.", "The Walrus's national reputation may overshadow the Whale's, but each has its own secure, winning personality.", "The Pacific Northwest is the only place where I'm overly excited about eating salmon these days, and the Whale's taut hunk of cured and smoked fish did not disappoint. It perched atop lentils mingled with chanterelle mushrooms, gently roasted tomatoes, and, for some astute sweetness, table grapes. A few leaves of tarragon lightened the dish with their licorice nip. The kitchen employed uncommon shrewdness with herbs in general: Clumps of parsley brightened sardines on toast slathered with curried tomato mayo (wonderful alongside the restaurant's standout pickle plate), mint brought extra zing to lamb tartare with preserved lemon and capers, and a handful of mixed herbs took the high notes in a tomato salad atop of romesco-like sauce of pureed peppers and walnuts. Even when a dish stumbled\u2014as with a funky, muddy-tasting nectarine soup that cilantro pesto couldn't uplift\u2014the intelligence behind the cooking was obvious.", "This isn't, then, so much a case of sibling rivalry. The Walrus's national reputation may overshadow the Whale's, but each has its own secure, winning personality.

The 104-seat room is all wooden plank floors, worn wood counters, and short, backless stools. There are plush booths, hung with flatscreens playing low-fi videos of crackling fireplaces on loop. (If only they showed the Yankees game!) The interior is shellacky in a studied, Midtown way \u2014 until you get to the spotless white kitchen. Lucky diners sitting at one of the seats at the chef's counter overlook a crew of cooks as silent and organized as those at a high-end sushi bar.

And you see at least one other patron searching for a staffer to take his credit card. You might acquiesce to such inconveniences if Salvation were a cheap burger joint. But Bloomfield taxes the wallet: She sells her namesake burger for $25 \u2014\u00a0and that's without fries, which at $7 a la carte bring you up to $32. That's as much as you'd pay for Minetta Tavern's dry-aged, butter-drizzled Black Label burger, or two dollars less than the famous foie gras-stuffed sirloin patty at DB Bistro Moderne. What that kind of price is saying to the diner is that the burger here is just as good as those other iconic patties. Unfortunately, it is not.", "April Bloomfield (left); Salvation's veggie burger", "This disappointment is not enough to discount April Bloomfield's ability. In a three-star review two years ago, I called her midtown restaurant, the Breslin,\u00a0the single best place to eat meat in New York. And here I'll make another big claim: No modern chef in New York has done more for restaurant burgers than Bloomfield. Sure, Minetta and DB Bistro deserve credit for convincing diners to cross that $30 burger rubicon, but those extravagances are one-hit wonders. Bloomfield, by contrast, draws crowds at her restaurants throughout the city with a deeper bench of more idiosyncratic burgers.", "At the Spotted Pig, she tops char-grilled beef patties with so much stinky Roquefort that, at most French restaurants, it would qualify as a cheese course. At the Breslin, she hawks lamb burgers topped with salty feta and cumin mayo that rank with dry-aged steaks for intoxicating headiness. And at the Ace Hotel lobby (where I'm a regular), she serves what might be her most underrated dish, a greasy blend of massively flavorful beef topped with intensely salty bacon and cheddar so aged that the taste is almost sour. While DB Bistro and Minetta convince New York to spend more by hawking unsubtle (albeit excellent) indulgences, but Bloomfield takes a more challenging route to luxury.", "Bloomfield has been a key player in the process of turning the burger from something infinitely mutable to something more dictatorial: a product of the will of the chef, not the consumer. Accordingly, she doesn't relegate the burger to lunchtime or coyly serve limited quantities at dinner, policies other chefs espouse because they fear guests will ignore the composed entree in favor of something more familiar. To Bloomfield, the burgers are composed entrees. At the Breslin and the Pig, they're among her most accomplished yet most affordable mains \u2014\u00a0just $25, and that's with fries. And they're all outliers in the burger canon: None are topped raw tomatoes, thin-cut pickles, special sauce, American cheese, or mayo. At least, none were in the pre-Salvation era.", "The namesake burger at Salvation, by contrast, functions like a ribeye at a brasserie.

Not by a long shot.", "Poutine (left); a diner under cow-themed art", "Cows, whose methane emissions make them the SUVs of the livestock world, aren't exactly the most environmentally friendly animals to consume. Bloomfield is aware of this, and accordingly, she uses the animal in a more sustainable fashion than your typical steakhouse. Every beef dish at Salvation Burger comes from one of four whole steers that the restaurant imports weekly from a farm upstate.", "This results in some surprises \u2014\u0080\u0094\u00a0like the beef heart on the menu, not something you'll encounter at Shake Shack. The muscle is sliced thin, marinated in balsamic vinegar, and torched over the kitchen's wood grill until it packs a soft, nourishing chew. \"86 heart,\" a cook shouts out one night, using the restaurant industry jargon for \"sold out,\" something you don't hear too often for off-cuts. The poutine can sell out early too; I only managed to snag a plate on my third visit, when I was presented with crispy fries, milky cheese curds, and heady oxtail in a gravy made from a Worcestershire-spiked Madiera reduction with a vinegary tang.", "Salvation never ran out of chili during my visits, which is a blessing, because the $12 bowl is better than anything Hale &amp; Hearty hawks for just a few dollars less. A waiter brings over a crock filled with guajillo-rubbed beef shank that's been cooked down with enough dried and roasted chiles to make your insides glow.

The point of a restaurant called Salvation Burger ought to be the burgers, four varieties all served on soft sesame buns. But aside from the vegetarian version, you can pretty much skip them all.", "Counter seating overlooking the kitchen (left); the classic burger", "Briefly: The cod burger is essentially fried fish getting soggy under the weight of tartar sauce. The classic burger ($17) is two griddled, grayish patties (with a touch of brilliant char) overwhelmed by so much special sauce and housemade American cheese it's like eating a soggy French dip. It's an expensively inferior analogue to Shake Shack's Double Shackburger.", "And that namesake Salvation burger, with its hefty price tag, is merely respectable. It's meant to be a seasonal endeavor, so depending on when you visit it might come anointed with taleggio and onions, maitake mushrooms and blue cheese butter, or taleggio sauce and ramp butter. The toppings all express themselves with gorgeous clarity, but they're milder and more subdued than her fireworks at Breslin or the Spotted Pig. And the meat itself is just okay \u2014\u0080\u0094 tender and medium-rare, but with only a modicum of beefiness. You don't feel as weighed down after taking down a whole burger here as at Bloomfield's other venues, but the tradeoff is you don't feel terribly inspired while actually eating it. Whatever Leonardo DiCaprio-approved, environmentally-friendly Tesla cow they're using isn't good enough. It's the chicken breast of beef, better as a conduit for flavor than being a compelling flavor itself.", "The fries don't help. They're just average bistro frites: skinny, crispy, a touch underseasoned. They lack the \"this must be Bloomfield\" trademarks of her rosemary garlic shoestring fries at the Pig, or the thrice cooked monsters at Breslin. They do not merit their a la carte price tag. Save that cash and spend it on dessert instead.", "As casual restaurants around the city overlook their pastry programs to save money and increase turnover, Salvation offers a list of pies and shakes that would rival the length of savory menus at certain tiny East Village venues. Right on. Grapefruit sesame or coconut cream are all about clarity of flavor. Fried hand pies, in turn, are an improvement on the classic; the flaky pastries are packed with tangy lemon or concentrated blueberries. Do not order the icy whiskey oat shake, which tastes like what would happen if a good restaurant put protein powder in one of its cocktails, or the grasshopper version, which uses its undetectable amount of creme de menthe as an excuse to get you to pay $14 for a mint milkshake.", "Imagine all the tourists staying in this hotel. Maybe they've heard of April Bloomfield from her excellent cookbooks or television appearances. And then they plunk down all this money for burgers that are just okay. It's really too bad: A meal at Salvation Burger doesn't give the culinarily uninitiated enough of an indication that elsewhere, Bloomfield is doing intensely interesting things.

He previously worked for Nate Appleman, then at Tra Vigne restaurant in St. Helena, California, and Margot McCormack, a Nashville chef who leans to French and Italian cooking but was also an early adaptor of the locavore credo. Wilson found his own space in a former artist\u2019s studio on a quiet stretch in the city\u2019s Germantown neighborhood.

This one uses potato as a textural base, with a Tennessee cheddar made of buttermilk broiled into a golden, crinkly layer of molten debauchery. Seasonal salads provide the caloric antidote. An early fall spread included pole beans and field peas with red onions and pickle dressing (the dirty martini as vinaigrette); half-moon zucchini slivers in tomato dressing with crunchy bits of bread somewhere in size between crumbs and croutons; and a simple, striking presentation of grilled octopus on a bed of cucumber slices with pickled chiles and mint.", "Pastas arrived covered in webs of melting pecorino strands. Gnocchi fashioned from cornmeal startled at first: The chew was denser than normal, but I came to appreciate their affinity for the dumplings simmered with greens in the South. Rigatoni with lamb looked more squarely to the Mediterranean, with blasts of cinnamon and black pepper that recalled the Arab influences in Southern Italian cuisines. Tangy cottage cheese made from buttermilk provided a novel base for pizza, matched with shards of delicata squash for contrasting sweetness and red onion for sharpness.", "Most winning among the entrees was catfish encased in toothy cornmeal crust, scattered with field peas, and lit up with lemon conserva and garlic.

It was early 2006, and Brock, only 27 years-old, was deep into a molecular gastronomy phase. His modernist tasting menu was separate from the restaurant\u2019s standard menu and could be requested only through Brock\u2019s personal blog.

In 2012 the hotel purchased 250 acres of countryside, which it named Double H Farms. Brown helps tend both the farm\u2019s organic garden and a herd of Red Poll cattle that supplies the Capitol Grille with beef. His menu is necessarily broad in the way of most hotel restaurants (the style is billed as \"Southern steakhouse\"), but he and his team bring finesse to dishes like an herbaceous salad of corn, charred cauliflower, and cherry tomatoes at their bursting peak, or meaty quail with cranberries and pumpkin puree.", "Southern food maestro John T. Edge turned me onto the Capitol Grille\u2019s truest glory: sausage and biscuits at breakfast. The buttermilk biscuits\u2014fluffy but not flimsy and with golden, buttery crowns\u2014are textbook. But the meat transcends easy labels. It\u2019s a variation known as \"sock sausage,\" in which cooked ground pork seasoned with sage and chile flakes ages briefly in muslin before smoking under low heat for seven days.

He wouldn't mind, for example, if I opened a review by stating that David Chang, the F-bomb-dropping chef and television personality, welcomed New Yorkers to the era of hour-long waits for 25-minute dinners with the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar in 2004. But he might take issue with me saying, right off the bat in the first paragraph, that Chang's latest endeavor, Nishi, is not a good restaurant. Not yet at least.", "I disagree with my erstwhile editor's strategy for many reasons, chief among them that now, in the era of Yelp and Foursquare, the people who read formal restaurant criticism are looking for a lot more than just the answer to a basic binary question: \"Should I go, or not?\" We read reviews to contemplate value: Is it worth my time and attention to pay $100 for a fancy Danish dinner in Williamsburg? We read reviews for vicarious experience: What is it like to snag a seat at a pizzeria that only doles out tickets via email once a month? We read reviews for context on the larger culinary world: Is fine dining broadening its appeal by taking inspiration from street snacks, or simply putting itself further out of touch by charging top dollar for things that used to be cheap?", "So, a restaurant review isn't just a restaurant review. It's a referendum on money, identity, and culture.", "Nishi, which opened in January, is not a good restaurant, but it's not a bad one. The Asian-Italian menu is a welcome reprieve from the city's ubiquitous onslaught of new-American and Euro joints. Take the spicy squid chitarra: It's a decadent calamari three-way (raw, dried, grilled) that wows as much with its funky XO sauce as it does with its classically firm noodles \u2014 an easy contender for cephalopod pasta of the year. Just one hitch: my enjoyment of the dish was heavily checked (if not entirely negated), by a whole host of other things.", "I did not express these opinions, good or bad, in the food-centric fact-check email I sent a few weeks ago to Momofuku HQ (\"Where do you source your baerii caviar from?\" and that sort of thing). What came back, however, was an uncanny anticipation of my concerns: \"We recognize that there is a lot to be done both from a kitchen and guest perspective to catch up with style of service and current menu,\" read a line in the reply. Or as Chang himself said to me in a phone conversation shortly thereafter, he wishes Nishi were better, \"but it's not and it bothers me.\"", "Though perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

To narrow the list, I look for stories that speak to the state of dining in the city right now. Sometimes those stories are obvious (l'll cover a buzzy new venue like Quality Eats to see if justifies the epic waits for walk-ins) and sometimes these stories are less obvious (I'll reexamine Brooklyn Fare because it's transformed itself from a BYO tasting table into one of the city's priciest experiences).", "Nishi falls into the former category. David Chang's restaurants get plenty of attention from the press, and there's a reason for that: the 38-year-old is one of the most influential chefs of his generation. He's responsible for transforming the humble Taiwanese steamed bun into an object of universal hipster desire at Noodle Bar, and he's trying to do the same with the spicy fried chicken sandwich at Fuku. He helped popularize, at Ssam Bar, the now-ubiquitous phenomenon of serving upscale share plates in stripped-down environments for a few dollars less than elsewhere.", "With Nishi, a pasta and raw fish hangout on Eighth Avenue, the Momofuku trajectory gets even more interesting. It's the company's first new, full-service New York restaurant in five years, and it's espousing a style of multi-cultural mashup that's new to the restaurant group. Italian-inspired dishes fortified with Asian ingredients is a model New York has seen before, at venues like All'Onda and Basta Pasta, but Chang is pushing the envelope a bit harder here. His kitchen replaces the anchovy in bagna cauda with fish sauce, for example, and the butter with walnut puree, and the result is pretty rad, the loose, funky crumble of the nuts evoking the coarse texture and umami of parmesan.", "Nishi is also the first Momofuku restaurant to adopt a no-tipping policy, which means prices are a bit higher to reflect the overhead cost of paying both cooks and servers a higher, more fair wage. If gratuity-free dining works here, it's likely Chang will adopt the policy throughout his empire, which in turn could spill over to other restaurant groups. In short, there is a heck of a lot riding on this place.", "I visited Nishi five times. My first experience was an impromptu late-night meal after working up an appetite at my gym, a few blocks away. Even at 10:30pm, the place was packed, with a few familiar faces in the house. (Hey there, Kate Krader!) Like any professional follower of restaurants, I'd seen the slideshows of Nishi's interior \u2014 there's a whimsical painting of a woman in a bathing suit riding what appears to be a post-nuclear apocalypse monster bicycle \u2014 but still, I was surprised by how spare the room felt in person, boasting none of the modest comforts that Chang has been leaning towards lately, at Ko and elsewhere.", "Blond wood bar stools, like the much-maligned ones at Noodle Bar, have flat seats with no backs or cushioning, and many of them, rather than overlooking the restaurant, give their occupants a direct view of a wall. The bright glare of the kitchen spills out into the dining room, contrasting with the dim light of the front-of-house. This is a barely tolerable scenario even by fast food standards (even McDonald's has seats with backs), and yet Nishi is among the most culinarily ambitious and sophisticated in Chang's empire.", "Joshua Pinsky, formerly of Ko, is the chef de cuisine. He riffs on cacio e pepe \u2014 a Roman dish that combines pasta, pecorino, and pepper \u2014 with something he calls ceci e pepe (\"chickpeas and pepper\"), taking out the traditional cheese and subbing in a proprietary chickpea miso substitute that Chang has dubbed \"hozon.\" Texturally, it's exactly like the traditional dish, packing a silky, creamy mouthfeel. But the hozon replaces the gorgeously stinky overtones of pecorino with a marked sweetness, one that the warming pepper more or less manages to keep in check. (A little finishing salt, provided upon request, helps even more). It's a dessert pretending to be a savory pasta, and it's absolutely majestic.", "It's the type of mind-bending creation that reminds me of some of my international encounters with Italian food, from llama-meat stuffed lasagna in the Bolivian salt flats to pizzas topped with mayonnaise (instead of mozzarella) on the outskirts of Moscow. What makes Nishi so exciting is that Pinsky is forcing New Yorkers to look beyond the framework of regional Roman or Sicilian traditions (or American red sauce affairs), and to meditate upon the fact that Italian food can be just as compelling when it's completely (and sometimes unrecognizably) interpreted through the eyes of another culture or chef. Nishi's food rebels against the shackles of authenticity.", "But then the check came, and my nascently forming plans to write about the restaurant in the context of the globalized Italian pantry, or maybe Momofuku's evolution as a restaurant group, went flying out the window.", "I was dining solo, and my meal of three dishes and three drinks ended up costing me $124. Sure, that's perhaps one more cocktail than the average dinner order, and yes, a zero-gratuity check is always going to be higher than one without. But still, instead of seeing the inconveniences and unpleasantness of the dining room reflected in a lower cost on my bill, I was paying close to fine-dining prices for the opportunity to sit on a seriously uncomfortable stool for the time it took to eat three courses and linger over a drink, and stare at a wall.", "On another night, I again showed up as a walk-in (most of Nishi's seats are unreserved; limited online bookings are snapped up weeks in advance), and the host quoted a 40 minute wait \u2014 at 10 p.m. Not a problem, I can't criticize a restaurant for being popular, so I told her I'd just wait around inside. \"Actually, we have a few parties coming in,\" she said. \"So we'll text you when your seat is ready.\" I was sent back outside, into the 17-degree weather. That really is a heck of a thing: a mostly-walk in restaurant asking its patrons to pay top dollar, without even offering them a place to sit (or even stand) while they wait.", "Unsurprisingly, the same thing plays out during prime time. I dropped by a little after eight on a Saturday; my companions and I were seated around 9:40. The wait I could handle. What I couldn't handle were the acoustics. With all the hard wood surfaces, the noise level at peak capacity is overwhelming, an auditory version of a shiatsu massage that never stops.", "Throughout all of this, service, under the auspices of general manager Sara Jimenez, is impeccable, and Pinsky's food consistently delivers. But discomfort and cacophony make for a poor environment in which to contemplate the subtleties of a $26 beef crudo (known elsewhere as a carpaccio) with shaved watermelon radish and dashi ponzu, or the $75 version of that hozon-laced ceci i pepe that's laced with black truffles (sadly shaved in the kitchen, not tableside).", "When the noise levels are that high, you stop talking to your companions because you're tired of asking, \"What did you say?\" You stop noticing the complex earthiness of the tartufi, because your other senses are overstimulated. You stop caring about how there's no bread service to mop up the scraps of your fantastic tofu-topped, Sichuan peppercorn-spiked beef shank bolognese. Instead, you're just thinking: When can we leave?", "Pork shoulder with white kimchi (left); Beef crudo with watermelon radish and black truffle.", "Restaurants are different places night to night, even table to table. A new restaurant is often an even more variable affair, rough around the edges, like seeing an off-Broadway play in previews. Each table gets a different bespoke performance from a different waiter, sometimes different dishes served by what are sometimes different chefs. That's why critics visit more than once, and why we usually wait a while for a restaurant to find its groove. It's also why restaurants soft-open: a few days or weeks of dress rehearsals at a limited price (or, sometimes, a full comp), to work out the kinks before officially opening to a full-price-paying public.", "Nishi isn't just charging full price, it's charging full price plus, participating in the noble experiment of selling a skeptical dining public on higher numbers on menus in exchange for a better quality of life for restaurant workers. And while the charcoal-grilled mackerel (which you should definitely order) is now, at $31, five dollars cheaper than it used to be, the team at Nishi has raised many of the other prices along the way. The ceci e pepi cost a dollar more than it used to, at $24; the penicillin cocktail, once $15, is now $17; and a dish of clams Grand Lisboa, once $27, is now $32. And then there's Chang's Instagram, showing off the $140 double order of truffled ceci i pepe.", "Quite a few restaurants operate worldwide under the Momofuku aegis \u2014\u0080\u0094 sixteen by my last count \u2014\u0080\u0094\u00a0and so I scheduled my review of Nishi to run about two months after the doors opened to the public. That's a little earlier than I might for a lower-profile restaurant from a smaller operation, one which might reasonably be expected to take more time finding its sea legs. And once I'd finished my official review visits not long ago, I sent over my fact-check email.", "Some version of that fact-check email goes out to every restaurant I review, to ensure that I don't inadvertently get anything wrong. In almost all of these notes, in addition to my basic culinary inquiries, is a variant on this question: How do you feel about the progress of the restaurant so far, and are there any major changes I should expect? Among other things, I want to make sure I'm reviewing a venue that's not going to completely change its menu in the weeks that follow my writeup, obviating its usefulness to my readers. (Buy me a few shots of Jameson and I'll tell you how I reacted when Corton closed just a few months after my four-star review.)", "Many establishments answer that question with a variation on something anodyne: \"We can't wait for the summer menu, and we're always trying harder to improve the guest experience.\" Momofuku responded with an essay.", "\"This restaurant was never intended or built for a concept like Nishi, and is much more suited for a Fuku+ or Noodle Bar style of service,\" the Nishi team wrote to me. (A bit of background: Chang called an audible and decided to open a proper restaurant here instead of a fried chicken joint, after signing on to launch a Fuku at Madison Square garden instead). The email went on to mention the restaurant's noise levels, the still-in-development bread service, the difficulties of keeping labor costs in check in a no tipping environment, and the slow pace of menu progression. Altogether, it was perhaps one of the most lucid criticisms I've read of any a restaurant, and it was coming from the restaurant itself. It was strikingly, almost confusingly honest.", "Chang himself backed up the email, telling me over the phone that acoustics \"have to get better\"; that the kitchen, due to overtime constraints, is still in \"training mode\"; that the dining room is admittedly lacking in traditional comforts; that the restaurant is contemplating adding tea service (even though there's not enough room in the front of the house); that the team is working on bread service (which is difficult because there's insufficient room to warm loaves in the back of the house); and that the entire kitchen needs an overhaul.", "I've never before presented restaurants with the opportunity to argue against my review pre-publication. And I didn't here, either. I hadn't told Momofuku I'd be writing about any of these problems, but the team clearly knows how much structural work Nishi needs that it's evidently ready to jump in and anticipate the flaws, to admit its mistakes before someone else can call them out on it.", "That's admirable \u2014 to a point. The question it raises, however, is whether other diners know that Chang knows that Nishi isn't up to par, whether they know they're paying full price for something a prominent, experienced restaurateur will preemptively acknowledge isn't good enough. And there's also the question of why Chang, a seasoned businessman, would keep running an establishment that his team admits is the wrong space for that concept, rather than temporarily closing and re-building the restaurant that his talented staff and loyal guests deserve. Chang told me during a phone call he'll be able to do a big renovation down the road \"if the restaurant is successful.\"", "He should do that renovation now.", "Nishi isn't a mom-and-pop joint operating on a shoestring in an inherited space. This is one of the world's most celebrated hospitality groups building a custom venue, and asking its diners to shell out top dollar for a unique, luxurious style of food, tinged with the glow of Momofuku's marketable brand of cool. But despite the brilliant work of the kitchen and the front-of-house team, Nishi is hobbled by its physical space, its prices, and its incomplete presentation of high-end dining. A restaurant isn't just food and service; without all the other elements in place, it can't deliver. It's not Jiminez's fault, it's not Pinsky's.

Gus\u2019s fried chicken in Memphis famously swats the taste buds with a cayenne backhand. But Nashville hot chicken is something else altogether.

My mouth thrummed, but it didn\u2019t set off alarms. The hot, however, took it to the edge. First there was a fleeting \"no big deal\" reaction: The spices felt gritty-dusty against the tongue, and I registered the skin\u2019s crispness, the vegetal flavor of the chiles, and the juicy flesh underneath. Then the fire began raging and the involuntary reactions kicked in. My nose tingled. My scalp felt prickly. I was suddenly gushing sweat, and so were my friends. Bites of creamy (otherwise mediocre) potato salad became our burn salve. All that said? We polished off both chickens. Not so much the sides of flaccid crinkle fries and cloying baked beans\u2014but those aren\u2019t what hook the devotees, anyway.

Hattie B\u2019s opened in 2012, the brainstorm of the owners of Bishop\u2019s Meat and Three in Franklin, 20 minutes south of Nashville. The Bishop family had begun experimenting with serving hot chicken on their cafeteria line and found it soon became one of their best sellers. Nick Bishop Jr. and his father, Nick Sr., wisely chose a location in Midtown Nashville, where families and office workers trail out the door at lunchtime. The instant success begat a second location earlier this year near Tennessee State University.", "Hot chicken with pimento mac-and-cheese and greens", "Hattie B\u2019s is also counter service but adds some true restaurant comforts to the hot chicken oeuvre.

(Skip the crinkle fries here too, though.) Local brews flow from the taps.", "The chicken comes in five levels: Southern (as in no heat, a thoughtful option for the chile adverse), mild/medium, hot, damn hot, and Shut The Cluck Up. As at Prince\u2019s I ordered medium and hot, and I found the burn at Hattie B\u2019s original location softer in both cases. Lovers of Sichuan cooking would likely handle the damn hot variation with ease. The hot version did sting, but through the cayenne\u2019s blaze the nuances of black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika helped round out the flavors. This was the sauciest version of hot chicken I\u2019ve encountered; the fat paper towel roll on our table dwindled fast.

Then gas prices surged, and societal awareness of climate change skyrocketed. All of a sudden, the truck\u2019s 12 miles per gallon seemed like not such great choice for driving your daughter to move-in at Oberlin. So people stopped buying them, and eventually General Motors stopped making them, instead focusing their attention on what buyers seemed to want: lighter, cheaper, more fuel-efficient cars. And the few Hummers that remained on the streets were revered (sort of) or reviled (hello) as classics (or relics). ", "I recount this tale because if you were to apply to the New York City steakhouse the same consumer logic that precipitated both the rise and the fall of the Hummer, you should theoretically end up with the same result. Theoretically. Lower beef prices in the gilded aughts fueled an Ozerskian breed of conspicuous carnivore, and restaurateurs indulged that desire with plush steakhouses at every turn.", "But beef prices now, like those of gasoline in 2007, are at an all-time high. And while we may rightly still tip our hats to old-time steak-slingers like Peter Luger and Keens, the truth is that we don't need any more steakhouses in New York. At least, we don't need them in the sense that they currently exist: uniform institutions hawking pricey shellfish platters, \u00e1 la carte sides, over-chilled Caesar salads, and gargantuan cuts of meat.", "Quality Eats inside (top) and outside", "But steakhouses are not Hummers. And instead of closing, or adapting in any real way to our modern, vegetable-centric culinary scene, they somehow keep on opening, increasing their prices and, occasionally, their portion sizes. And why not? The leather booths are still packed.

It boasts the beefiness of a hanger and packs just a hint more heft than a filet mignon. You may have encountered it at an affordable French bistro, but it's almost never spotted in a steakhouse setting. The importance of this can't be understated: Quality Eats is forcing the modern meat eater outside of her high-flying comfort zone, depriving her of New York strips and Tomahawk chops. And it's making that bump back to cattle class more attractive with a discount, the $19 you'd spend on that bavette would, at Minetta Tavern, barely buy you a beet salad.", "Quality Eats is run by Michael Stillman, son of Alan Stillman, the man who opened the first TGI Friday's in 1965 and was the force behind the Smith &amp; Wollensky chain. Stillman fils inherited the family propensity for steakhouses, giving the world Quality Italian (a chophouse that reads like a more corporate Carbone) and Quality Meats, the Midtown restaurant that sells 64-ounce cuts and ice cream by the pint, and which loaned its name (while withholding a key consonant \u2014 the M is scratched out in the logo, and conspicuously absent above the restaurant's door) to Stillman's latest endeavor.", "Quality Eats' hanger steak (left) and crab and avocado starter", "It's understandable that Stillman's other restaurants, like so many New York steakhouses, exist in the realm of the jaw-droppingly expensive. Over the last seven years, rising beef costs have morphed the best cuts from an every-week treat to an eye-popping, once-a-month luxury. But all costs are rising, and they're rising for everyone \u2014\u0080\u0094 labor, benefits, real estate, ingredients \u2014\u0080\u0094 and the restaurant industry is adapting. As expense-account tasting-menu spots like Brooklyn Fare and Le Bernardin push their prices further into the stratosphere, a crop of restaurants\u0080\u0094 like Contra, Semilla, and Estela have sprouted up, all hawking more affordable takes on small plates and set menus.", "It's smart business. These new-model restaurants are catering to a larger audience. They're not just responding to the most recent downturn; they're preparing for the next one. But, until Quality Eats, there isn't really anyone in New York reimagining the steakhouse in the same way. It's surprising that the genre has shown such intransigence in adapting to the financial straits of aspiring gourmands, in giving anything more than a curtsy toward our (nominally) healthier culinary zeitgeist, or in addressing the disparity between waiter pay and cook pay. (Name a steakhouse in this city that has joined the movement to eliminate tipping, and I'll buy you dinner at Masa.)", "\"The Don Ameche\" (top) and curly fries", "But Quality Eats, with its sub-$30 steaks and casual dining room (no white tablecloths here), is speaking to that younger, hipper diner \u2014\u0080\u0094 and yet again, as with singles bars in the \u201860s and high-end steak chains in the \u201870s and \u201880s, the Stillman family shows the rest of the city how it's done. The concept certainly seems to be finding its audience: Try to snag a week-ahead reservation for Quality Eats and you'll get, at best, a 10 p.m. booking. Or try walking in, and risk waiting nearly an hour for two seats at the bar to open up. Quality Eats is proof, for now, that it's possible to successfully tweak the steakhouse formula.", "Of course, if a restaurant wants to keep menu prices low, something else has got to give. That casual interior's not much to speak of: white walls, painted brick, hard bar seats, padded banquettes that look like any other, and a bar top carved to resemble a set designer's idea of a high-school cafeteria table: \"yum,\" \"menu suck,\" \"dope,\" \"sick,\" \"let's get ice cream.\" (The words and drawings show up again on some of the plates used in service.) And unless you're sitting in the more spacious back room, you'll find it difficult to move about, let alone luxuriate in your seat with a postprandial rum.", "The chef, Ryan Bartlow, late of Frankies 570, does a fine job of reimagining steakhouse starters. He piles thick-cut bacon, the classic appetizer, above a swath of peanut butter, turning the smoked pork into a playful but mysterious little dish; a drizzle of jalape\u00f1o pepper jelly cuts through the fat, while the peanut amps up its sweet campfire overtones. If Bartlow ever served it on crusty sourdough at lunch, he'll have his cronut.", "Beef tartare doesn't reach Wildair levels; it's rather an estimable (if oversalted) essay in using chopped filet as a conduit for piment\u00f3n, fish sauce, and gochujang. Shrimp cocktail on ice is a classic effort in court bouillon-poached crustaceans, with miso mayo and ginger soy sauce accompanying the traditional horseradish-laced ketchup. And lump crab, typically served in a chilled chokehold elsewhere, recalls a lunchtime composition from Jean-Georges. Bartlow lays the white flesh atop a green pool of avocado-cilantro-jalape\u00f1o puree; he sneaks pink grapefruit segments here and there as well, lending wintry pastel and gentle acidity.", "As with many steakhouses, steaks at Quality Eats are essentially a la carte \u2014 the accompanying heap of greens and tiny ramekin of corn creme brul\u00e9e don't really count as add-ons. The restaurant doesn't sell the traditional hash browns, creamed spinach, or mashed potatoes; here's what you can expect to pair with your meat.", "Curly fries: Orange-hued frites seasoned with cayenne, salt, paprika, garlic power, and parmesan, with a sting from a scattering of scallions.", "Saut\u00e9ed greens: Spinach cooked down with sesame oil, ground red chile paste, and garlic, gently spicy and salty.", "Cacio e pepe orzo: Rice-shaped pasta \u2014 good for sharing \u2014 tossed with the iconic Roman blend of black pepper and pecorino.", "Scalloped Sunchokes: The trendy roots are mandoline-sliced and served under a cheese sauce of aged gouda and parmesan.", "Baked potato monkey bread: When I ordered these bacon butter- and chive-topped pull-apart rolls at the beginning of one meal, they didn't arrive until halfway through the main course.", "Then a bartender clears your plates for your steaks, which appear 20 minutes after you're finished your starters. Or sometimes the server doesn't remove your dirty dishes until the entrees finally arrive. And then no one clears your mains until you ask for a check, so a server hands you a dessert menu, after which you ask for a check again.", "There's the rub. Service, especially at the bar, evokes the type of hospitality experience one might expect from a budget airline, not from a restaurant family with decades of experience purportedly making people happy. Over four visits, I only twice ended up getting everything I ordered. Red wines were consistently too warm. Catching the bartender's eye was a matter of military strategy: one minute he's facing the wall, the next he's checking his phone, the next he's busy eating sunchoke gratin with sriracha.", "But let's stick to the larger themes. You're here for red meat, not the lemon charred chicken or Mediterranean branzino. Steaks, sourced from hormone-free, antibiotic-free Brandt and Creekstone cows, are cheap and delicious. Here's the rundown: The flatiron blade is short on flavor but big on chew, not necessarily a bad thing for those who enjoy a bit of umami-rich mastication. The skirt steak boasts a hint more flavor and tenderness than the flatiron, while the hanger exudes massive juiciness, with the concentrated flavor of consomm\u00e9.", "Even the filet mignon (listed on the menu as, improbably, \"The Don Ameche\") knocks it out of the park: Bartlow amps up the neutral cut by plating rare slices over smooth-as-foie-gras chicken liver toast. The only real misses are the long-bone short rib (a tough, 12-ounce cartilaginous cut that tastes of bitter, carbonized char), and a patty melt whose sweet caramelized onions and melted American cheese obliterate any flavor of beef.", "Desserts, largely a variety of ice creams topped with toasted marshmallows or chunks of birthday cake, are skippable.

But passing up on that drink would be a mistake, because it's one of the city\u2019s finest new cocktails.", "It's unlikely you'll make this version of the drink at home. Nicholas Bennett, the mustachioed head bartender, injects CO2 and phosphoric acid into a batch of corn whiskey and homemade cola syrup, carbonating the entire concoction at once. This process creates such a uniformly bubbly libation that Bennett could serve it in a Champagne flute as pass it off as faux-sparkling wine \u2013 just like the famed gin and tonic at his old stomping ground, Booker &amp; Dax. Now take a sip. Does the Whiskey Cola taste a bit more complex than usual? That's because Bennett adds a dose of Fernet-Vallet, a Mexican cordial whose medicinal overtones transform the entire concoction into a boozy cardamom-clove-quinine coke. The beverage is normally poured over ice, but ask for it straight out of the glass bottle it's stored in, all the better to appreciate this masterpiece in its astringent, undiluted glory.

The 33-year-old Sag Harbor native pours a Hurricane on par with Maison Premiere's, Brooklyn's preeminent New Orleans-themed watering hole.

Even better is his punch, a malty mix of Old Tom gin, amontillado sherry, black tea, and maraschino, all poured from a tap; it boasts the concentrated tang and gentle burn that you'd expect from something served in a flask, which this is, with a paper straw.

Or rather, its incarnation with luminary chef Thomas Keller as its owner does. The 1890 stone building, nestled among vineyards in a small Napa Valley town, began its life as a restaurant under the same name by a couple, Don and Sally Schmitt, in 1977. Keller had trained in restaurants in France and New York and ran a restaurant in Manhattan called Rakel that ultimately failed in 1990. The Schmitts served meals in a Chez Panisse-like format, with one set menu that changed nightly. When Keller took over in 1994, he offered a four- or five-course dinner with options in every category. Soon, he would begin concentrating on tasting menus that included a flurry of whimsical small bites to start the evening.", "", " ", "\"Coffee and doughnuts\"", "In his years between running restaurants, Keller percolated on ideas that would eventually reset the nature of upscale American cooking. At The French Laundry, he melded European technique with dishes that were embedded in our national consciousness. His take on \"coffee and doughnuts\"\u2014cappuccino semifreddo with hot cinnamon-and-sugar-coated orbs\u2014was an early hit and gave him confidence to keep the pushing the boundaries of wit: \"Surf and turf\" with monkfish tail and braised oxtails, \"Caesar salad\" with Parmigiano-Reggiano custards, \"Banana split\" with poached banana ice cream and crepes. Due to Keller's precision, these creations never came off as gimmicky. His approach forged new contextual territory in the food culture, and gave French cuisine\u2014always the basis of his cooking\u2014a place of honor at a time when \"New American\" was the mantra in restaurants.", "So much has been said over the years about The French Laundry and the empire it spawned. (Keller hasn't manned the stoves at the Laundry since 2005; chef de cuisine David Breeden oversees the kitchen day-to-day.) I came to a recent meal intrigued to see how the experience fit in among the newer generation of tasting-menu restaurants. Many of them are run by Keller disciples, including Grant Achatz of Alinea and Next in Chicago, Corey Lee of Benu in San Francisco, and Rene Redzepi of Noma in Copenhagen. The relative newcomers take wilder leaps of imagination and exotica than the Yountville standard-bearer, which can seem downright traditional by comparison.", "And by no means am I using \"traditional\" as a euphemism for \"boring.\" A person can't feel ennui amid such a whirl of attentiveness, a style of intelligent, unusually personable service perfected by former general manager Laura Cunningham.

We started off with goug\u00e8res and then the salmon cornet\u2014France and America each in single mouthfuls. The courses seesawed between richer and lighter, sharper dishes. Pleasantly astringent avocado and buttermilk soup came before Keller's signature \"oysters and pearls,\" a sabayon of pearl tapioca with two tiny oysters and a quenelle of white sturgeon caviar that resembled a giant mulberry. To cut the decadence: a square of translucent mackerel, its fishiness assuaged by Meyer lemon and frisky piquillo pepper.

The original came with butter-poached Maine lobster, but as restaurants across America glommed onto the idea, Keller and his crew came up with new versions: This one brought together handmade tube pasta, sweetbreads, and a binding sauce fashioned from fava beans. Out came the humidor box, and one of the staffers giddily buried the dish in black truffle shavings. (I should add that the dish comes with a $100 supplement charge atop the meal's $295 base price, but for such dizzying luxury I'd say go for it.)", "  ", "Herb-roasted veal; \"Pawlet\" cheese course; Sour cherry mousse", "A veal dish wrapped in leaves and mousse made of cabbage, with a pierogi filled with a ragout of corned veal heart (scrumptious), was followed by a small, charming cheese course: Pawlet, a nutty cow's milk variety from Vermont, was cut in a thin, fluted circle to match a fennel pollen shortbread cookie. Finally, the desserts arrived: sour cherry mousse, then yogurt sherbet with a brown sugar-maple tart, and then a layered chocolate torte flavored with Virginia peanut and caramel made from Banyuls vinegar. And just when we thought we were done, the server arrived with one last treat: \"We couldn't let you leave without our 'coffee and doughnuts,'\" he said.

At those next-gen tasting menu restaurants, unexpected ingredients and jolts\u2014a chicharron made from sea cucumber, a kimchi dumpling that shattered in the mouth\u2014made meals as much about novelty as pleasure. The French Laundry is more about experiencing the familiar in elevated ways. I respect both approaches. Which do I recommend more? If you're young and want to understand the groundwork of modern fine dining, head to Yountville. If you've dined before at Keller's paean to perfectionism and have an open mind, try Benu or Saison.", "But even the jaded should keep an eye on The French Laundry. Keller recently announced that he's renovating the restaurant, which will include a new 2,000-square-foot kitchen. The restaurant certainly isn't hurting for reservations, but Keller wants to stay big-picture relevant.

And if you want to drill down even further, Restaurant Associates is part of Compass Group, a global foodservice organization with a market cap of \u00a316.89 billion (USD ~ $28.4 billion). Too bad these smart folks can't figure out the economics on limes.", "Saul has, however, figured out how to charge you a bunch of money. The tasting menu is $85. Not a single dinner entree is under $30. And an a la carte meal will easily run $100 per person.", "Pol Roger, the only bottle of Champagne, costs $110, a higher starting price for high-end French bubbly than other, better restaurants.

The trick of course is to accommodate daytime or early-evening eaters who want to get in and out fast (or back to the exhibits), while also courting destination diners who can fill the restaurant and settle in after the museum closes. Danny Meyer has perhaps struck this balance better than anyone else at The Modern, a Michelin-starred spot with small plates in its bar room and set-menu dining in the back. Even better: Patrons can directly access Meyer's packed space from a lively stretch of 53rd Street in Manhattan.", "To directly access Saul, you walk around the exterior of The Brooklyn Museum and enter through the back by the parking lot.

Most will enter Saul through the front, walk past a security guard, continue on through an empty museum lobby, hang a left, then a right, past another security guard, then through a set of doors that leads to a hallway with chairs stacked on top of the tables. The hosts may or may not greet you on the way in or out. Charming, right?", "", "And then there's the question of ambience. When dining in a museum, it's nice to actually see the museum. Those seated in the spendy back room at The Modern are treated to a panoramic view of that institution's famed sculpture garden via floor to ceiling windows.

Nasty stuff. It's also large enough to serve as a small meal in itself. That's followed by a preternaturally sweet diver scallop. Right on.

By kismet, Rodgers had been placed with the famed Troisgros restaurant family in France as a high school exchange student; it sparked her curiosity for French and then Italian cooking. She came to care more about the foods that people consume daily than the twinkling pinnacles of the Michelin three-stars. Her specialties reflected it. She realized the potential of the restaurant's Caesar salad, and she roasted chicken in the brick oven that the owners installed soon after she came on board: It became her defining dish. She was among the first to go gourmet with the humble burger, grinding the meat in-house and sandwiching the patty on grilled rosemary focaccia with just-garlicky-enough aioli.", "A meal at Zuni feels like a homecoming, even if it's your first time.

They're impressive, even for a critic like this one who normally looks upon that creation with the same disdain as its culinary cousin, the wrap. The key at Cantina is that the burritos come sans rice. That means the interior is more of a soft stew of nourishing deliciousness than a starchy brick. Some bites burst of beans and soft, pulled pork. Other bites pop with cilantro, avocado, onions, and scallions.

But their offerings are also broader, and many of the dishes, particularly entrees, similarly derive from among the swath of Indian cuisines. The main difference is that the food as Rasika is bolder, the flavors punchier and less rounded.", "That holds true for the atmosphere as well. The scheme at the second Rasika in West End, which opened in 2012, is downright conceptual: Rectangular wood panels climb up a column into the shape of a modernist Bodhi tree, and a silvery hand reaches over a glass partition, sculpted into the shape of a Buddhist mudra.

I lunched at the original recently, though I urge first timers to go for dinner, when the meal feels more like an occasion. (The menus are identical.) We started with uttapam, a pancake made from fermented rice and lentil batter, studded with seasonally appropriate white asparagus. The mustard seeds and curry leaves seasoned overtly, and the dollop of coconut chutney on top took the dish home to South India. Crab revved with plenty of ginger and garlic came stacked with peppered phyllo dough that visually imitated poori, the breads that balloon while frying. A swift char on shrimp glossed with mango created a smoky sweetness. Mixed grill\u2014salmon roasted in the tandoor oven, chicken scented with green cardamom, a smooth-textured lamb kebab sprightly with garam marsala\u2014proved a satisfying m\u00e9lange of proteins. The only miss was a strange variation of poriyal, a coconut-flecked vegetable saute from the Southern state of Tamil Nadu, this one starring broccoli. The ingredients needed to better merge.

Memories of my Maryland childhood shook awake at its mention. A caloric wonderland of a casserole, the Chesapeake region recipe typically includes lump crabmeat folded into mayonnaise and a cream sauce (or melted butter) with seasonings like dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce, sometimes sherry. It was served on its own in scalloped shells or as the capper for stuffed fish. I ordered it every chance I could as a kid, though its brazen richness started becoming unfashionable by the mid-1980s.", "  ", "Yet here was crab imperial reincarnated at the hottest restaurant in Baltimore.

Eating it reminded me I was home.", "Woodberry Kitchen electrified the town when it opened in the rehabbed Clipper Mill industrial park in 2007. It was the most forward-thinking Baltimore restaurant in years; even Washingtonians journeyed to savor the finesse of Gjerde's food. In every mid-size American city last decade there seemed to be at least one chef who led a committed charge toward local sourcing and building lasting relationships with nearby farms. In Charm City it was Gjerde.", "But something else has changed\u2014deepened\u2014in the restaurant's direction. After my recent dinner at Woodberry Kitchen I went back to my parents' house in the suburbs and rooted through a stack of papers on the desk in my old bedroom. It's not news that food critics swipe menus, but when a meal makes an impression I tend to save the pieces of paper that I shove folded and crumpled into my pockets. I found a menu from my previous meal at Woodberry, during Christmas vacation in 2009, when it was easier to book a same-week reservation at a decent time. I held the old menu up alongside the new one. The differences were obvious. From 2009, the list of dishes boasted global inspirations: fried rice with shitake mushrooms and egg, poutine, sizzling shrimp, pork loin with buckwheat crepes, roasted vegetables with polenta. In 2014, many more options directly reference Maryland heritage: oyster stew, chicken and biscuits, crab cakes with tartar sauce, rockfish in several preparations. There are nods to Baltimore's longstanding immigrant communities, including roasted kielbasa with potato salad and Greek salad.", "Wreckfish with crab Imperial", "Plenty of other current dishes\u2014braised beef with grits, whole porgy roasted in the brick oven with tomato rice, five different flatbreads, pea shoots with pickled kohlrabi and tarragon yogurt\u2014sound enticing purely on their own merits. But it is heartening to find Gjerde adapting recipes that engender such a clear sense of place. Other cooks around the country might follow suit. I'm not suggesting that creative minds tether themselves solely to community cookbooks and grandma's recipe box. I think, though, that the next step in the local-seasonal movement is for chefs not only to be champions of the land but also stewards of regional foodways.", "Gjerde has shown his love for oysters from the Chesapeake Bay's estuaries since Woodberry's earliest days, but in the last seven years the selections have doubled. We slurped a few saline beauties fresh from Virginia waters and spooned up others simmered in an appropriately simple cream- and milk-based oyster stew. From their shells we scooped out several others that had been roasted and dressed with port cream and smoked ham, or with the house hot sauce, called Snake Oil, made from a local chile variety known as fish peppers. The peppers were once widely used by Maryland cooks but then nearly forgotten. Gjerde convinced some growers to plant heirloom varieties. Their impressive heat waded through Woodberry's \"crab pot\"\u2014a double entendre for the crock holding hot dip that also refers to the name of the traps used to catch crabs. The dip's foundation was quark, similar to fromage blanc, and it was doused with sherry, a flavoring for dairy and crab dishes that stretches back to the country's founding.", "On the lighter side, a thin piece of toast balanced lush hunks of rockfish surrounded by a halo of young chicories, dill, spring onions, and other greens. The meal's single disappointment was the Greek salad, an interpretation that included kohlrabi, pickled green tomatoes (mingled with their ripe red counterparts), slivers of fresh fish pepper, and ricotta subbing for feta. The herb dressing that should have united all these elements was so light that we probably should have sent the dish back: I'm convinced now it was missing altogether.", "\"Crab pot\"; Rockfish on toast", "Mindful of their cholesterol (and worried about the lack of concern for my own), my folks urged that we order the chicken and biscuit, a disassembled, defatted version comprising a nicely browned breast angled over braised greens, roasted asparagus and carrots, pan jus, and a tawny biscuit that managed to be flaky and sturdy at once.

Quesadillas ($9 to $11) are huge flops of folded-over masa dough, rather than the stateside bar snack of parallel flour tortillas glued together with cheese. In this case they\u2019re stuffed with mushrooms, squash, chicken, or just cheese. One thing to skip is the ceviche, which features fish, pineapple, and jicama mounted on two small tostadas. The problem with the restaurant\u2019s version is too little fish.

The sushi bar is plush, but the counter\u2019s so high you can\u2019t see what the chefs are doing to the fish. That fish is of exemplary freshness and offered at discount prices compared to restaurants of similar quality, undoubtedly due to the buying power of the chain. Most expensive is an omakase, coming in at $55 for 11 pieces of nigiri sushi and half a maki roll. In one instance that roll featured otoro (fatty tuna, the fanciest type), and the nigiri highlights included a plump scallop lightly seared and surmounted by a face of crunchy lotus root with two preserved-plum eyes; a slice of fatty fluke with a tiny dab of dilled mayo; and a piece of nicely cooked salt water eel.", "[The dining room at Mi-Ne Sushi; part of the omakase.]", "As if that weren\u2019t enough, the omakase is heralded by an appetizing tour de-force consisting of nine tiny plates arrayed in a square, each with a single salutary biteful. Some involve sashimi, others seaweed, shredded vegetables, roe, or pickles. Later you get a small bowl of chawanmushi custard. This omakase constitutes too much food for one person, and it\u2019s one of the best sushi deals in town. Other equally generous sushi and sushi/sashimi assortments are priced from $28 to $39.99. But the restaurant\u2019s sushi stylings don\u2019t end there.", "It\u2019s one of the best sushi deals in town.", "In trying to cover all the bases, in addition to hand rolls, maki rolls, and nigiri by the piece, Mi-Ne offers temari (\"hand ball\") sushi, its fish deposited on buttons of rice, aimed partly at children. As the\u00a0website notes, \"It\u2019s not really a seasonal food, but you can see a lot of temari-zushi in spring, around Girl\u2019s Day (March 3rd) in Japan because temari-zushi is very colorful.\" Who knew? But some of the menu\u2019s most interesting offerings \u2014 which run to a bewildering 170 items \u2014 are not sushi at all, but Japanese regional specialties rarely seen in New York City.", "  ", "A portion of the Omakase", "From the page devoted to Kyushu cuisine: slices of lotus root tempura ($6.99), the holes oozing tangy Japanese mustard with miso; pork shabu-shabu ($12.99), which invites you to swish raw, lightly smoked bacon in bubbling water before dipping it in ponzu sauce; and, perhaps betraying the proximity of Kyushu to Shanghai, deep-fried shrimp toasts flavored with shiso leaf. Other menu items include tofu made with milk instead of soybean curd, and a broiled tuna collar ($19.99) so massive the restaurant asks it be shared among three or four diners. Miso-marinated black cod (a classic Nobu recipe) and two kinds of pok\u00e9 suggest the owners have carefully examined our city\u2019s current restaurant scene before drafting their bill of fare.", "This eclectic approach has its downside, too, especially in a page of maki rolls supposedly invented in America, which might be seen as confirmation of our own bad taste in sushi. Worst is a hire katsu roll ($13.99) in which a thin breaded pork cutlet with the texture of cheap leather is wrapped up, still steaming, in rice, proving nearly impossible to chew. Maybe less deplorable is a black cod roll that puts the aforementioned broiled fish on top of a thick roll stuffed with avocado and pickles \u2014 one is well advised to pick the morsels of fish off the top and eat them separately.", "Ultimately, though some of the food is uneven and the service somewhat fumbling (as compensation, the tip is included in the already low prices), Mi-Ne is a great place for Japanese food of a diverse nature, or simply as an alternative to sushi bars with considerably higher prices.

The nutty luster of tahini, the wafts of cinnamon and earthy za'atar, vegetable salads lolling in olive oil, spiced lamb in every permutation: Their prominence in our national culinary identity is overdue.", "Ana Sortun was an early ambassador for these cuisines. She studied at the famed La Varenne cooking school in France and then moved to Massachusetts, working for a Tunisian-born chef, Moncef Meddab, then running the kitchen at Casablanca restaurant in Harvard Square. In 1997, Sortun travelled to Turkey where she encountered pomegranate molasses, spice blends as brain-teasing as jigsaw puzzles, and airy pita pulled fresh from the oven. Four years later, she opened Oleana in Cambridge, celebrating these sun-dazed flavors and demonstrating how nimbly American ideas can meld with the ingredients of the \"Mediterranean\" (a Middle Eastern restaurant euphemism ripe for retirement).", "Is Oleana still relevant 13 years later, in the age of Yotam Ottolenghi's cookbooks and fusion fattoush? I visited both Sortun's flagship as well as Sarma, the new small plates restaurant in Somerville (a couple miles northwest of Boston) where Sortun is a co-owner.", "Labneh-filled burrata; Cacik", "Our warm-spirited server nearly lost my attention when she began to describe burrata as a special. Let's formally designate the milky-buttery mozzarella as the molten chocolate cake of the 2010s. But then she went on: \"The kitchen hollows it out and fills it with labneh flavored with za'atar and serves it with grilled pita spread with chopped morels and green garlic.\" Hmm. Stuffing burrata with yogurt strained to the thickness of cream cheese did sound tempting \u2026", "It was, in fact, a dairy rendezvous\u2014a meeting at the intersection of smooth and delicate. The yogurt gave the cheese shell a tangy new angle. The lemony za'atar merged with the mushrooms and garlic on the pita, intensifying each bite in the same way that herbes de Provence adds fragrant depth to ratatouille.", "The lesson: If the choices at Oleana seem overwhelming, just look for yogurt and all will be right. Cacik, a classic Turkish dip, blends labneh with spinach, mint, cucumber, and garlic. It comes in a circle, dotted with spiced chickpeas and indented in the center to hold a pool of olive oil. Orbs of spinach falafel sprawl over a magenta bed of yogurt and beet puree, so soothing against the fried garbanzo's crunch.", "", "  Quinoa salad with carrot-saffron soup", "Yes, Oleana remains very much germane. Sortun and chef de cuisine Cara Chigazola have mastered a tricky symmetry: Their food, even when occasionally pulling from current American trends, tastes true to the lands of their inspiration. The plating is modern and pretty without detracting from the crucial interplay of flavors.", "Take the chickpea terrine, an igloo-shaped mold of hummus, firmed up with pureed potato, and filled with braised greens, golden raisins, pistachios, and dried apricots. Tahini sauce is spread across the top like freeform frosting, flecks of Aleppo pepper look like bacon bits but taste tart and hot, and a shallow well at its crown contains a tablespoon of pomegranate molasses. All the elements flirt with one another. In another special, a pebbly beach of quinoa salad with date puree disappears under a tide of carrot-saffron soup poured tableside. The soup's complex sweetness offsets crisp crab croquettes floating in the center of the bowl. Ouzo aioli acts as a rich-toned backup singer to a duet of grilled broccoli and firm sfela cheese crusted with walnuts and sesame seeds.", "", "  Shawarma", "Sortun's husband, Chris Kurth, grows the produce for the restaurant at the couple's farm: The quality shines through in dishes like a reinterpreted shawarma, with lush shreds of lamb snug in crackly phyllo with pickled turnip greens, bright and pleasantly bitter. And don't leave the cozy dining room without having dessert. Longtime pastry chef Maura Kilpatrick opened nearby Sofra Bakery with Sortun in 2008. Kilpatrick sees Oleana's thematic through-line to dreamy conclusion with creations like Turkish profiteroles filled with brown-butter cream, slicked with sesame caramel, and finished with crumbled halva and cashews.", "On the side I ordered what became the meal's only off-note: A gritty, muddy cup of Turkish coffee. I much preferred sipping on a sour cherry spritzer of sorts that came with bohsalino, a rectangle of pistachio paste scattered with fresh cherries. In the sour cherry drink bobbed a popsicle made with mastic, the edible resin popular in Turkey that hints of pine.", "Squid saganaki; Labneh with za'atar", "Sortun's latest project is a partnership with Cassie Piuma, Oleana's former chef de cuisine whose previous gigs include a stint at Providence's Al Forno. It opened this past September, and in a reflection of the times it's a more casual restaurant, modeled after Turkish tavernas known as meyhanes. Fittingly, a large bar with neon-green stools takes up nearly half the space. Ornate plates purchased in Istanbul line one turquoise wall, setting the scene stylishly against the dominant motif of exposed brick. The setting at bistro-like Oleana calms; the scene at Sarma rouses.", "Likewise, Sarma pushes boundaries more playfully. The kitchen focuses even more squarely on small plates, broken up into categories like meze, shish (foods cooked on brochettes), savory pancakes and pies, and the namesake sarmas, or rolled and stuffed dishes. Young, engaged servers encourage diners to kick off the meal with riffs on bar snacks\u2014perhaps dates stuffed with goat cheese and fried in sheer batter, or sesame-coated haloumi fries with white fig ketchup, the next generation's mozzarella sticks with marinara. Balls of labneh coated with za'atar harken to yesteryear's chevre balls rolled in herbs. Here, too, there are many dairy-sluiced seductions.", "And after we've ordered squid saganaki (a stew heady with olives and ouzo), straightforward lamb souvlakia (threaded on a skewer and grilled), and a version of fattoush with strawberries and arugula that strayed a little too far from the original for my liking, another server approached the table. He was circulating specials from a tray, dim sum-style. First up: hunks of boneless fried chicken, with sesame, nigella seeds, and green chile enlivening the rippling crust. Fried chicken is the universal language of food. Sure, why not?", "The staff parceled out the dishes evenly and thoughtfully: A meat dish would arrive with a seafood or vegetable counterpart. Aromatic cocktails, local brews, and glasses of appropriate wines like Greek Xinomavro went down easily. Ultimately, I preferred the more finessed cooking at Oleana, but both restaurants have obvious value. For residents well acquainted with Sortun's culinary dimensions, Sarma is a plucky, fresh vantage on those balmy flavors.

It's no wonder. Guy Fieri has turned it into a sauce for chicken. McCormick has transformed it into a dry-rub seasoning for tilapia. And the highest-profile iterations on the drink come out of corporate chains like T.G.I. Fridays or Applebee's. The mojito is not in fashion, and that's a large part of what makes it fit so well at Guantanamera, a thrillingly unfashionable Cuban restaurant in Midtown West.", "When you order a mojito at Guantanamera, the bartender does not scowl at you. She deftly muddles the classic trio -\u0080\u0094 lime quarters, mint, and sugar -\u0080\u0094 adds rum, shakes it all over ice, tops it with soda water, and delivers you a boozy highball in 60 seconds flat, about a quarter of the time that it usually takes to get a martini in this town.", "The mojito is not a pretty cocktail, nor should it be. It is not clean, like so many of today's perfectly emulsified, overwrought tipples, strained through wire mesh with the same urgency that a French chef might bring to clarifying veal stock. The drink's deep flavors comes from all the pounding, prodding, and shaking of previously attractive ingredients. Drifts of smashed lime and bruised mint float about in what looks like a glass of cloudy pond water.", "Some sips of Guantanamera's mojito taste heavily of rum. Others taste of mint that's more grassy than sweet. Still others taste of lime that's more pithy than bright. A splinter of sugar cane floats near the top; you can chew on it like a toothpick if the alcohol ever gets too heavy. Polish off the beverage and what remains is not an empty glass, but a slipshod terrarium of verdant refuse and fibrous, molar-marked cane stalk.", " \r", "This is what you drink while eating Guantanamera's grilled squid; the meat of the charred mollusks as slick and creamy as the garlic sauce they sit in.

They play until just before midnight, but the bar stays open until 1. Order one drink, then order another.", "Guantanamera sits on a stretch of Eighth Avenue that was as unhip in 2005, when it opened, as it is now. The restaurant's red rectangular awning, which extends all the way out to the curb so patrons can catch a cab without getting wet, is more faded than La Grenouille's. A glass-enclosed display on the sidewalk outside alerts passers-by to the restaurant's deals and musical acts. The contents of the display rarely change. The menu doesn't change at all.", "I learned of Guantanamera's existence not by way of a magazine or a friend or an Instagram power user, but rather by walking past. It's a block and a half from my apartment, in a slice of Midtown West that's not quite Columbus Circle, and not quite Hell's Kitchen. I lived nearby for over a year before stepping through the door, and when I finally did drop by it wasn't because I was looking for a place to review, or because I was looking for an excuse to opine on the resumption of American flights to Havana after a fifty-year hiatus. I started dining at Guantanamera because I left the office late one night and didn't feel like Citibiking up to P.J. Clarke's for a burger. It was nearby, and I was hungry. I walked in after 10pm, and the place was packed.", "The band plays to a packed dining room (left); a plate of vaca frita", "Guantanamera is unhip, but that doesn't mean it's uncrowded: the bar can fill up 'til closing time on weekday nights.

What cut of the cow does the meat on the pinchos come from? \"It depends,\" says a manager. \"It's mixed.\"", "Though the classic cubano sandwich may have originated in America, Guantanamera's rendition is perfect: It bears a thin, almost unnoticeable slice of ham which essentially functions to provide color contrast to the main event: musky hunks of slow-cooked pork, spilling out over the edges of chewy baguette that's been pressed and crisped on the griddle. Pickles cleanse the palate, but then again, so does the mojito.", "I'd happily tell you about the chef, whose menu pays homage to the diversity of Cuban cuisine, which draws from Spanish, African, Taino, and Caribbean fare. Just one problem: She or he isn't mentioned on the menu, or on any of the restaurant's promotional material. But I can tell you about Juan de la Cruz, a man who's prominently featured on Guantanamera's website, and who's the first person you'll see in the restaurant on a Friday or Saturday. He's not the host. He's not the bartender. He is, by his own description, a \"professional Cuban cigar expert,\" and he sits by the window and uses what he assures his customers is Dominican tobacco to roll what the restaurant describes as \"complimentary baby fat stogies for customers who want to savor a sidewalk smoke reminiscent of the days of the Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta of 1950s Havana.\"", "De la Cruz, bald and lean, is a man of precision. He wears a crisply laundered button-down and rimmed glasses. His hands move across his workspace without ambivalence; watching him manipulate tobacco is no less mesmerizing than watching a master sushi chef mold nigiri. He eyeballs the binder leaf and shapes it down to size with a circular caveta knife. He adds filler leaves, rolls them up, snips off the wayward end with a table cutter, and places the aromatic cylinders in a wooden press for shaping. The finished products sit by the anteroom window like a pile of aromatically incendiary Lincoln Logs. Is there any other culinary establishment that gives out nicotine products, and that advertises this policy in public documents in post-smoking-ban New York?", "A taste of Cuba at Guantanamera (left); the restaurant is on a bustling but unhip stretch of Eighth Avenue", "Guantanamera is not a food-person restaurant. It's a third space \u2014 somewhere that isn't home but isn't work \u2014\u00a0but not the kind with free wifi; there's no one writing code on her MacBook Air. It's a venue where half the bar seats are reserved by drinkers smoking outside (some of whom are drinking outside too), where patrons watch the game while eating a dinner that's not chicken wings, where guests salsa even though there's no dance floor, where live music plays without the requirement of a cover charge. Guantanamera is a place to hang out without the constant pressure to order another $15 cocktail, though you'll certainly want to. It is a social club without the membership or the mafia. Walk by during brunch, and you'll see a guy beating out some tunes on the bata drums by the open windows, his drums the colors of the Cuban flag.", "\"That's a dry dish,\" I hear a waiter say when a patron attempts to order the vaca frita. The diner balks, and opts for mozzarella stuffed chicken instead. Really. Don't let the staffers discourage you from one of Cuba's signature beef dishes. Vaca frita (\"fried beef\") is cooked skirt steak that's been shredded, seasoned with mojo, and re-crisped on the griddle. The result is something like warm, tender jerky, with a musk so beefy and powerful it's delivered with a wedge of lemon or lime. Matched with the traditional rice and beans, it's easily a one-plate meal for two. Same goes for the picadillo, a big pile of raisin- and olive-studded ground beef with an egg on top, and the ropa vieja, the iconic dish of slow-simmered flank steak and peppers that's tender as cotton candy.", "The palomilla steak is tempting; at its best, the preparation involves tenderizing a cheap cut of top round by slicing it thin, marinating it in lime and garlic, and quickly cooking it over high heat to a sizzling crispness. But what the kitchen puts out here is just a thin, underseasoned, overcooked steak. Chicken Guantanamera, by contrast, is excellent: a crispy half bird drenched in a world of garlic sauce. Lechon asado (slow-cooked pork) exhibits the type of soft flesh and heady aroma that can keep hunger at bay through a one-hour rumba set, or longer. It arrives with boiled cassava, drenched in garlic butter.", "Guantanamera is proof that there's still a rich restaurant world beyond those glittery places with PR campaigns or viral Instagram love, that those restaurants can find ways to remain crowded ten years after opening. It's also a great place to get a mojito and a filling meal. And for me, at least, it's a reminder of how nice it is to find a restaurant the old fashioned way: by walking around the block, stepping into a crowded space you've never heard of, and feeling right at home.", "Ryan Sutton is Eater's chief restaurant critic.

At O Ya, what comes under that label is an expression of harmony, and one example of chef-owner Tim Cushman's elegant redirection of Japanese cuisine. The idea for the creation began with a piece of nigiri sushi, the rice properly warm and threaded with vinegar. Cushman, a New England native, had Maine lobsters in his kitchen and wanted to use every part of them. He thought about his childhood, when his mother would employ a rolling pin to extract the meat from the creature's spindly legs. They were Cushman's favorite part.", "\"Legs and eggs\"", "To fortify the squiggly leg meat, bound to the rice by a nori ribbon, Cushman added a few grams of osetra caviar and tomalley sauce (made from the lobster's liver) for uni-like sea funk. Flurries of yuzu zest and diced chives sharpened the pitch. The result was a thumb-size masterwork, luxury minus the pretension and tasting of cultures that entwined without conflict. It cost $27 for two pieces. I'd gladly pay it again.", "O Ya's 40 seats, half of them at a long bar, have been steadily occupied since the restaurant opened in 2007. It was an improbable debut.  The place resides in a former firehouse in the city's leather district near the waterfront. The area is clogged with commuters during the evening rush hour and then quickly falls into an otherworldly silence. Cushman, who runs O Ya with his wife, Nancy, had never owned a restaurant before, though he had worked in food for three decades. He'd become a consultant specializing in stranger-in-a-strange-land restaurants: an Italian trattoria in Hong Kong, a deep-dish pizza parlor in France, a tapas bar in London. All the cross-pollination gave him the confidence to create a menu built on Japanese cuisine (which he loved but had no formal training in) that incorporates a worldly array of flavors.", "Kumamoto oyster with watermelon and cucumber", "Also: Cushman is a guitarist who graduated from Boston's Berklee College of Music. The man understands structure and cadence, tension and resolution, and that comes through in his cooking. He composes in bites, so his food is more in a form resembling virtuoso pop tunes (Brian Wilson, not Katy Perry) rather than lengthy symphonies. He sears hamachi, adding smokiness to sweetness, and then layers in acidic contrast with banana pepper mousse\u2014odd-sounding but effective. Cucumber mignonette and tiny watermelon spheres gently buoy kumamoto oysters. Pork ribs are brined in tea, the tannins standing up to the meat. Olive oil bubbles, atop diver scallops in sage-scented tempura, fade like last night's dreams before your taste buds even register them.", "Cushman's rhapsodies can be experienced either \u00e0 la carte or through omakase/tasting menus. The basic seventeen-course tasting menu starts around $185, give or take the night's ingredients, with a grander presentation of $285 for seven additional courses embellished with caviar and other rarified ingredients. Yes, the latter puts the meal's starting point somewhere between San Francisco's Saison and Los Angeles's Urasawa. In this instance, I prefer rambling through Cushman's ninety-plus \u00e0 la carte possibilities. Many of the best dishes are on both menus, and I was more drawn to select what felt most enticing in the moment. Our server had a cowboy-casual demeanor, disarming for a Japanese restaurant, but he paced the meal deftly and doled out solid advice on sakes and wines by the glass. (Hint: Rieslings work well here.)", "Daikon dumplings; Rock shrimp kakiage", "Two of us devoured seven riffs on nigiri and sashimi: Beyond the \"legs and eggs,\" another particular favorite was uni crowned with dashi gelee and lightened by the mysterious, vanilla-like essence of tonka bean. Daikon dumplings acted as a bridge course between sushi and cooked items: The short-lived but influential raw foods restaurant Roxanne in Larkspur, California, inspired the dish. Cushman soaked the radish in a soy marinade to soften it, folded the slices around a miso-nut puree with mild kimchee and toasted garlic, and dressed the plate with nori sauce, ginger-scallion oil, and a variation on mayo made with pine nuts. Lots going on, yet it all clicked. We enjoyed a slow-cooked onsen egg (named after the hot springs in Japan) bathed in dashi but liked it even better as part of a bowl of thin somen noodles with fried squid.", "Yuzu curd", "If you order foie gras nigiri, one of Cushman's signatures, there's no need for dessert. Servers know to bring the foie, painted with balsamic chocolate kabayaki (eel sauce) and capped with cocoa pulp, as a finale; a tumbler with a splash of aged sake comes alongside. Yuzu curd with spiral meringues and streaks of blackberry-jasmine sauce, while pretty, felt redundant afterward.", "After six years focusing on their firstborn, the Cushmans are expanding to New York. In May they launched a rooftop bar in Manhattan's Park South hotel, which is undergoing renovation and is where the Cushmans plan to open a restaurant next spring. Watching Tim divide his time will be fascinating. I can't imagine how his Boston corps of cooks (including several Japanese sushi chefs behind the bar) will manage to keep the catalog of dishes straight without him; maybe he'll streamline the menus.

Well, not really, but in our primary Chinatowns of the Lower East Side, Sunset Park, and Flushing, the restaurant population has remained relatively static and even dwindled over the last few years, as the most interesting new Chinese restaurants have sprung up in non-traditional settings. The reason? Regional Chinese has gone mainstream \u2014 as Chinese-American did a century ago \u2014 and developed a real fandom among the general population. Thus we find, for example, food from Shaanxi Province easily accessible at the multiple locations of Xi\u2019an Famous Foods, while Hunan cuisine has gained traction in the East Village at Hunan Bistro.

Madam Zhu, please make your dining room comfy! While the liquor license is still pending, the signal beverage is a choice of premium teas, at $6 to $8 per pot. In fact, the restaurant offers a separate tea service in the afternoon, and the entire place seems more inspired by Chinese tea houses than full-blown restaurants. A large proportion of the dishes are small \u2014 so maybe Hao Noodle is also channeling American tapas bars. Luckily, the deliciousness level is often very high.", "Recipes are drawn from many parts of China, and the menu is to be commended for not pulling its flavor punches, especially where Sichuan food is concerned. One of the best short plates is Le Shan chicken ($10) \u2014 tidbits of poultry in a gingery swamp of chile paste and Sichuan peppercorns heaped with finely diced celery, named after a small riverside city in southern Sichuan. In fact, the best deal on the menu is in a similar vein: milky mung bean jelly stacked like railroad ties, enhanced by crunchy peanuts ($6). It may be the spiciest vegan bowl in town. Other Sichuan standards include a version of dan dan mian ($8) with the softest noodles imaginable. (This isn\u2019t Italian food, and the glove-soft texture is a revelation). But the best dish on the menu, with a breathtakingly green broth, is Madam Zhu\u2019s spicy fish stew ($25). Watch out, tongue!", "Le Shan Chicken", "Never fear, there\u2019s plenty of not-hot stuff, too. Shredded wild mushrooms that make you think of Yunnan \u2014 which is the Chinese capital of mushrooms \u2014 rest in what amounts to a crunchy puzzle box ($12), while fritters of fish flecked with seaweed seem like Japanese fast food. Chinese-American standards are represented, too, proving that Madam Zhu has been studying the history of Chinese food in America. Thus, scallion pancakes have been enlivened with shreds of seafood to good effect; on the negative side is a sweet-and-sour pork with chunks of pineapple that made me almost gag. (Yes, the precursor comes from Dongbei, but this take is clearly inspired by the gloppy American version.)", "The restaurant provides startling selections in every corner of the long and diverse menu. As the waiter doffs the handsome lid of clay pot dumplings ($12), the steam rushes forth to reveal flattened purses made of egg omelet rather than the usual noodle material. \"What a deal,\" you sigh as you tease the pork-filled packages out of the broth. Other dishes are not such a bargain, including Shanghai ribs that came plated like an abstract painting, but with so little meat on the tiny bones that my party burst out laughing.", "  ", "Rosewater jelly and mixed mushrooms", "The place seems intent on belatedly mounting a new seasonal menu every quarter, with little poetic snippets here and there \u2014 and thus it was that summer appeared in August this year at the restaurant. A few old favorites I\u2019d been enjoying over the last couple of months disappeared, including braised celtuce, a chewy vegetable sometimes called Chinese lettuce. And in their place were some new things, including a few off-the-wall recipes that made Hao Noodle seem like one of the hipster restaurants flourishing on the edge of Chinatown. There was a perfectly executed fruit salad sprinkled with black pepper; but even stranger was something called multi-grain rainbow salad ($12).", "There before me as I peered mournfully into the bowl was a collection of faddish grains, including buckwheat, millet, and quinoa, tossed with roasted root vegetables, yellow raisins, and pine nuts like a bad day at Dimes.

The approach was polished yet unusually warm, closing the gap between upscale and casual dining.

A special of sliced New York strip came nestled in the lap of springtime. The beef was splayed over a bright, masterfully sharp puree that included angelica, green chickpeas, ramps, and spinach. The creamiest chickpea fries stood in for potatoes. And I loved the way Anthony used pork in ways usually associated for beef. A piggy Bolognese tossed with tagliatelle had an appealing unctuousness and meaty bite, and he included the little-seen pork spinalis muscle (sometimes known as the rib cap or deckle in beef) with roasted loin for added richness and textural variation.

The reclaimed redwood paneling gleams ruddy and handsome; the geometric copper light fixtures cast flattering shadows. We had a 6 p.m. reservation and the evening started leisurely.

It lends a sweet, salty base note rich with umami\u2014a Barry White rumble that evens out the tinnier tones of freshly shaved bottarga. For creaminess and further harmonics, the bread is slaked with a sauce of shio-koji (a salty version of koji, which I'm banking will be a hot ingredient nationwide in the next few years), pureed potatoes, butter, and beef fat.

But here's what's even better: Pasquale doubles down on that emerging great-wine-for-everyone ethos with a plan to lure in both the snobs and the amateurs by serving their pizza-friendly vino in some of the world's best glasses \u2014 but also by making it ultra accessible, with any of the non-sparkling \"seasonal\" wines (of which there are 56, none over $75) available by the half-bottle for half the list price. That's a rare and generous policy, one that translates into a path to sampling that Manzoni for as little as $35.", "The obvious benefit is to the diner's wallet, but there's something more important going on here: Pasquale is lowering the barrier to entry to trying an off-the-beaten track wine not just from a financial perspective but from a consumptive perspective. Just as a chef has more opportunities to try and fail with experimental dishes over a long tasting menu, rather than having to play it safe over a four-course meal (where, due to the limited scope, each course has to knock it out of the park), an aggressive half bottle program encourages diners to take more risks while drinking.", "This all the more important during a pizza meal, which tends to run shorter than other dinners. A party of two, who'll maybe only typically order a single bottle of Nebbiolo over their 90-minute dinner, can at Pasquale Jones now double their variety and take a chance on two 375ml experiments, opening their palates to wines perhaps too rare or edgy for a restaurant to open up and move by the glass.", "Maybe I'm diving too far deep into the behavioral microeconomics of pizza pairings. But as much as the sports-jacketed sommeliers at tasting menu venues are changing the way fine-diners drink by expanding wine pairings to include sherries, sakes, beers, cocktails, and mocktails, the waiters in denim shirts at Pasquale are changing the way pizza-eaters drink by using the pies to get us in the door, and exposing us to wines we've never heard of.", "Pasquale Jones's clam pizza", "As dining rooms throughout the city cut back on amenities to keep prices reasonable amid rising labor and real estate costs, Pasquale counts itself among the rare non-exorbitant restaurant to keep your back straight and your posterior padded. It's comfortable \u2014 not an adjective one usually associates with pizza parlors.", "Bar stools and banquettes boast lumbar support. Temperature levels remain bearable, even for those seated in front of the wood-burning ovens. Sound levels are never quite as ear piercing as one might expect at such a hip venue (Charlie Bird's decibel levels were brutal in its early pre-soundproofing days). Those scented candles in the bathroom? They're a reprieve from the woodsmoke gently perfuming the dining room. Hosts check your bags without giving you a ticket; they remember who you are. About a third of the dining room is available for booking via Resy, and if that's how you roll, you'd best log on to the app a good two weeks out, when seats are released. The rest of us will wait about 60-90 minutes as walk-ins.", "The wait is worth it. Ryan Hardy crafts his pies in the New York Neapolitan style, which means no soupy centers or droopy crusts. Nearly every version is perfect, from the brilliant clam and amatriciana pizzas to the margherita pie, whose tomatoes exude aromas that veer from sweet and easygoing to vegetal and tangy. The spicy salami pizza is the requisite pepperoni riff, with the clutch inclusion of Calabrian chiles. They look like chopped up cherry bombs and impart the pie with the type of deeply funky flavor one might expect if a farmer were to water his vegetables with lamb broth. Match that with a half bottle of Vignai Da Duline Schioppettino, with its reserved dark fruit notes, and you've got yourself a nice segue to the mammoth pork shank for two, a mound of achingly rich, fall-apart swine.", "The precision of Hardy's non-pizza kitchen doesn't quite approach the wonder of his pizzas, technically or creatively, but the fare is enjoyable enough. The pea salad with ricotta is fresh and bright, steelhead crudo shows off the oils of good trout, a dish of braised leeks with walnuts and parmesan packs about as much flavor as a decent delivery salad. Pastas are distinctly average, from the gritty, overcooked, undersalted Roman gnocchi, to porchetta agnolotti, which takes two powerful flavors \u2014\u00a0black garlic and braised pork\u00a0\u2014 and somehow makes them almost unnoticeable. Chicken is overcooked, and tilefish is a study in how to drown delicate maritime flesh with too much olive oil. It's as if Hardy's approach to non-pizza cuisine is to create a subdued canvas that won't get in the way of the wine, which universally has far more personality.", "Pasquale Jones doesn't have a pastry chef and it shows; the single sleepy dessert on offer (which changes regularly) evokes the phoned-in confections that David Chang used to serve at Ssam Bar in the pre-Christina Tosi era. On one of my visits, Hardy warmed up strawberries in the oven and topped them with mascarpone gelato; at a later meal, he served the fruit raw with that same frozen treat and a splash of elderflower syrup. It tastes fine \u2014 only a human with an iron heart would turn down a sundae \u2014 but it would be nice if a restaurant of this ambition served something that I couldn't put together at home in under a minute.", "But it's a small complaint. Perhaps forgoing a dedicated sweets chef is a reasonable enough tradeoff for a restaurant that strives to stay affordable while offering so many other luxuries. And despite no-tipping setbacks at other casual restaurants, the team behind the restaurant tells me the hospitality-included policy is working out just fine here.

Inquire after the area's upscale favorite for anniversaries and the answer might be Persimmon in Bristol, a nearby seaside town. Its chef and co-owner, Champe Speidel, marries local tradition (elegant, fritter-like clam cakes poised over a lush clam chowder) with primo ingredients and modern notions (striped bass tartare, duck breast with foie gras-stuffed morels).", "But the first name in Providence restaurants remains the same one that first drew national attention over thirty years ago. Johanne Killeen and George Germon opened Al Forno in 1980. They'd met at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she studied photography and he focused on sculpture and architecture. Their mutual zeal for Italian cuisines led to running a place that initially only served during the day, the idea being that they could both concentrate on their art after the lunch rush. Customer enthusiasm quickly convinced the couple (who married in 1981) to switch to dinner, and cooking has been their main form of expression since.", "The building in which the restaurant resides, once a stable near the city's waterfront, is the kind of space that artists would love\u2014quirky and boxy, with plenty of nooks and long, narrow dining rooms on two floors. Predating the current debate in food circles by decades, Al Forno has long rejected the idea of reservations. Show up early or late or there will usually be a wait. A friend and I arrived around 6:10 on a recent Wednesday and hung out for only 10 minutes before a table was ready. We briefly ducked into the upstairs bar, snug and beckoning with its backlit shelves and marble tiles. I asked a staffer for a cocktail list. \"Nah, we don't have anything like that, we're a classic bar,\" he said. A Negroni then, please, sir.", "Grilled pizza with kale pesto", "Once we sat down to eat, the first order of business was obvious: Which grilled pizza should we order? This dish, more than anything, put the restaurant on the national radar. The story goes that Germon was talking with a fish supplier who'd recently come back from Italy and was raving about the grilled pizza he'd tried in Florence. It turned out that the guy was confusing a grill with a wood-burning oven, but the idea stayed with Germon. When he and Killeen experimented with dough cooked directly on the grilling grates, they were taken with the charred pockmarks left by the flames, and the texture that seesawed between crisp and chewy.", "Al Forno's pizza deserves its pedestalled status. We chose one dotted with Tuscan kale pesto, which arrived in the shape of a flattened, stretched-out boomerang. Grill marks on the crackery crust were visible through a base of fontina and pecorino cheeses, topped with pools of tomato sauce, the roughly pureed pesto, and scallions strewn like confetti. If I lived in Providence I would eat it as often as possible, vacillating between this version, a simple margherita, and perhaps a variation zapped with chile oil. I would leave the one topped with fried onion rings for the college students eating here with their parents.", "Bing cherry and almond tart", "The restaurant also does something brilliant that other ambitious (non-tasting menu) restaurants should emulate: It asks diners to order desserts at the beginning of the meal, because the kitchen bakes cookies and tarts \u00e0 la minute. I love this approach. It gives carefully prepared sweets their deserved respect. They become a thematic consideration rather than an afterthought. We anticipated our finale all through dinner, and were rewarded with a rustic bing cherry-almond crostata enriched with vanilla bean cr\u00e8me anglaise, and a bowl of dense, silky, freshly made caramel ice cream studded with candied nuts.", "The beginning and the ending left the most memorable impressions, though the kitchen delivered other pleasures in between as well. Panko-crusted cod cakes came decorated with spoonfuls of smashed avocado for cool, smooth contrast, with slices of lemon tucked underneath to cut the fish's saltiness. Hot, freshly grilled croutons gave an otherwise textbook Caesar salad some pep to its personality. Clams were paired with hunks of spicy sausage, a combination with roots in the local Portuguese community. A blob of mashed potatoes, suffused with butter and heavy cream and with flecks of red skin visible, put the dish squarely in the realms of Americana comfort.", "Cod cakes with smashed avocado; Clam roast with sausage and mashed potatoes", "Interestingly, the most traditional Italian preparations were the least compelling. A rolled veal cutlet stuffed with Gorgonzola was endearing in an old-school-red-sauce-joint sort of way, but the meat emerged from the wood-burning oven chewy enough to tire the jaw muscles. And I'd been advised by another food writer to try a baked pasta number like shells with tomato, cream, and five cheeses. I veered and went for the free-form lasagna with meatballs; the ingredients didn't coalesce and the tomato sauce was soupy. It would certainly have been better the next day.

The dish is not that expensive, and it's not that spicy. It's vegetarian, but without any vegetables. It is buttery noodles but without butter. It's a classic that's been turned into a condiment.

They're an Italian improvement on French goug\u00e9res, little balls of asiago-laced pate a choux fried until they reach a proper crispy-on-the-outside-gooey-on-the-inside texture, and then dusted with pecorino and pepper \u2014 as if they were savory street fair zeppole with a little touch of heat.

Robbins tips her hat to the Italian-American tradition of old with what the menu calls \"burratino toast,\" and which turns out to be an exceptional take on garlic bread.

The mirror effect in a bowl of squid ink rigatoni was even more arresting: The black pasta was cut to match the shape of squid ringlets, and they had such a similar al dente texture that I had to concentrate on the flavor to distinguish them. Fried clams were too heavily battered for my taste, though I admired how the other, powerful elements of the dish\u2014preserved lemon, pickled peppers, an ancho\u00efade (similar to tapenade) as black as tar\u2014breached the crust to zing the clams.", "Squid ink rigatoni; Octopus \u00e0 la plancha", "Maws is known for his meaty predilections (one menu signature is confit and roasted pig's head for two), but the kitchen revealed a delicate hand with seafood.

It's all a recipe for high noise levels, but keeping the sound level in check are high ceilings and a soft fabric art installation \u2014 a burlap rendering of Manhattan that doubles as a nice head rest for those of us sitting against it.", "Do yourself a favor and order from the A-list of egg-on-a-roll sandwiches, which include the Hickorytown \u2014 a sweet mess of fried bologna, frizzled onions, and gherkin mayo \u2014 or the Pastrami &amp; Hash \u2014 a perfect geological cross section of stretchy crimson meat, soft brown potatoes, fluffy yellow eggs and a verdant jalape\u00f1o puree that's tangy then spicy. Spillage, even without a wax paper wrap, is minimal.", "Or try the Meatpacker, a stunner of a $16 platter that includes a pile of funky, spicy coppa, soft broccoli rabe, two eggs any way, Old Bay potatoes (nuclear-sized chunks that taste of the Chesapeake), and, best of all, homemade malt sausage, a meat whose soft mouthfeel, pink hue, and livery aftertaste evokes a cross between Canadian bacon and scrapple. It is without question, one of New York's finest carnivorous options, and the platter itself rivals an English breakfast in its calorie content and deliciousness factor.", "Kulp took an unconventional approach to opening his New York restaurant. Rather than kicking off with dinner and then waiting for the reviews to pour in, the venue debuted with breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and then added on nighttime hours a month later. High Street, in other words, was almost instantly an all-day brasserie, a risky move for such a young venue.", "Of course, staying open throughout the day can help any young restaurant meet its financial obligations more quickly. At least,\u00a0theoretically. The downside can be enormous: higher labor costs if guests don't show up (there's no captive hotel audience here), greater opportunity for errors amid the increased offerings, and a staff that will almost surely be overworked, no matter how deep the bench of cooks and waiters.", "And yet, High Street pulls off the all-day experience with aplomb. No, the 60-seat spot doesn't quite have the space (or the wifi) to act as a true third space between home and work, the type of venue like Lafayette or the lobby at the Ace where four-tops can drop by for coffee only and end up spending an entire Saturday afternoon typing away on their MacBooks. But you can usually snag a stool behind High Street host stand and spend an hour or two during a slow lunch sipping a cortado and reading the paper. And for those who are skeptical about the usefulness of an institution where the brunch waits can exceed an hour, consider this: a dedicated takeout counter gets patrons in and out in under 10 minutes, even during peak hours. Not even a busy bodega can always accomplish such speed.", "The \"daily breads and spreads\" platter", "So if the queue drags on, pick up a cinnamon raisin bagel to go, saunter over to the High Line (a three-minute walk), and enjoy the super-chewy, naturally leavened treat on a bench while gazing out over the Hudson. In fact, that's where I ate half of High Street's stunning gabagool sandwich, an old school pairing of salami, iceberg lettuce, stinky provolone, spicy peppers, and musky pork shoulder, a gorgeous salt bomb of cold cuts on a soft a sesame hero.", "The sandwich lineup can be hit or miss, with its dodgy roast pork and frankly terrible pastrami on rye, with cold, blubbery meat and an incongruous smear of cole slaw. But then there's the excellent, if incorrectly named, Bodega Sandwich: eggs, cheese, and malt sausage on a biscuit. (The proper New York bodega sandwich comes, of course, on a roll.) Another clutch choice is the sliced turkey: The kitchen cooks the fowl so gently and cuts it so thin it practically dissolves in your mouth like p\u00e2t\u00e9. Is it as compelling as the original honey-marinated version from Torrisi Italian Specialties, where Kulp worked as chef de cuisine for years? It sure comes close.", "As the afternoon sun dims and High Street switches to dinner, attention in the restaurant turns away from the sumptuous windows and back toward the room itself. This is when a diner might notice that there's an extra-wide path between the tables, leading from the front door back to the kitchen. A man in a motorized wheelchair and a baseball cap hangs out near the chefs. Later on in the evening he rides down toward the front of the house and greets guests.", "This is Eli Kulp. Last May, the six-foot-four chef was en route to New York via Amtrak 188, the passenger train that derailed at Frankford Junction in Philadelphia, killing eight on board and injuring 200. The derailment sent Kulp airborne, and he hit the luggage rack with his neck, leaving him without the use of his legs and with limited mobility in his hands.", "From top: The Bodega Sandwich, sunflower risotto, High Street on Hudson's take-out area", "Kulp's imprimatur is everywhere in the restaurant, though culinary director Jon Nodler and chef de cuisine Taylor Naples does most of the cooking. But remember this name: Alex Bois. Bois does the baking, overseeing what truly sets the restaurant apart from the competition: the bread, both by itself \u2014 the High Street style is an armor-like crust and a moist, almost under-baked crumb \u2014 and as an integrated aspect of the larger culinary operation. Such a dedication to the craft of leavening is a true luxury in this era, when so many in-house bakery and pastry programs have been on the chopping block, an easy operation to cut in the face of rising costs.", "On Saturday, a bowl of samples sits on the takeout counter; they're cubes of anadama bread, a New England-style deli loaf forged from cornmeal and molasses. At dinner, that same bread appears as toast, a crispy conduit (and foil) for the rich oils of barbecued eel.", "Brunch guests smear malted butter (imagine the caramel overtones of dulce de leche, minus the sweetness) atop slices of nutty, caraway-packed rye. Breakfast patrons use sunny-side-up eggs as dipping receptacles for a potato bread so ethereal it's as if Bois knows how to transform meringue into a complex carbohydrate. And upon leaving, smart diners will indulge in the ultimate take-home treat: a cherry-buckwheat loaf whose fruit tames the intense earthiness of the dark cereal grain.", "You could, of course, simply order the $8 bread board for your dinner, and make a light meal of it, but that would mean overlooking the kitchen's more ambitious fare. Kulp might've created the tripe dish of the century, brining cow stomach for 48 hours before frying it, cutting it into strips, tossing it with guajillo peppers and sriracha, and finally finishing the whole thing over charcoal. The finger-friendly starter boasts the crunch and heat of hot wings, as well as the satisfying chew of warm beef jerky, the sort of thing that wouldn't be out of place at a Super Bowl party.", "Pastas are a smart order, from paccheri in a suede-brown buffalo ragu (how handsome!) to cauliflower caramelle, little dumplings filled with sweet root vegetable puree. But the real head-turner here is seaweed bucatini. The soft, dark noodles arrive draped under a blanket of rose-colored petals, a red Lamborghini with a black leather interior. Those petals, as it turns out, are lobster coral; the kitchen shapes the roe and shaves it like truffles. The taste is pure shellfish and ocean water, intensified by a factor of a hundred.", "There are heftier mains, too, that don't quite deliver in the same way \u2014 a somewhat spongy sous-vide beef here, a too-sweet honey glazed chicken for two there. Better to stick with the pastas and finish off with caraway rye ice cream \u2014 that High Street bread game is everywhere. And as you leave, the host offers you a tray of cookies to choose from on your way out the door.", "It's all quite amazing: As New York operators streamline and strip down their operations in this era of high rents and rising minimum wages, a guy from Philadelphia rides into town and makes an affordable little restaurant feel as bountiful as Eleven Madison Park and as welcoming as a Thanksgiving at your aunt's house.

These days, the city's modern raw bars serve New England specialties alongside dishes laced with global flavors. I recently bellied up to two of the most popular seafood counters in Boston.", "Oysters and Jonah crab claws", "Apparently a dozen of us had the same clever idea: Show up at 2 p.m. for a late Thursday lunch to avoid the notorious lines at one of the North End's biggest draws. Didn't happen. The cheerful server manning the door at Neptune smiled apologetically and told us the wait would be around 45 minutes. This did not surprise my Bostonian friend. To stave off hunger, she suggested we split a square slice of Sicilian pizza (the crust was remarkably light) around the corner at Galleria Umberto. The Neptune server called after 35 minutes, summoning us back for seats at the marble-topped bar.", "Jeff Nace and his wife, Kelli, opened 42-seat Neptune in late 2004. The place has always maintained an eclectic menu covering a breadth of raw and cooked seafood options. Michael Serpa, Neptune's outspoken chef for five years, creates entrees that pull from many cultures: a take on San Francisco's cioppino; roasted branzino with feta, olives, and other Greek overtones; maritime \"steak frites\" with yellowfin tuna; a Veracruz-style fish preparation (tomato softrito, cilantro, and green olives) made with Nantucket striped bass.", "But simple, regional fruits of the sea lure most strongly, because the place crackles with the frisson of a classic American oyster bar. Customers scrunch in together at the counter or along an L-shaped, candy-apple-red banquette. Globe-shaped fixtures hang from a pressed-tin ceiling; sconces flank mirrors with thick, pewter-colored frames. The mad shucking of oysters and clams leaves a seashore tang in the air.", "Our bartender, capable but not especially warm, slid us a sheet with a dozen oyster selections and a few more seasonal enticements. It listed origins and flavor profiles: Onsets from Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, for example, were medium size, high in salt, and had a \"seaweed finish.\" I appreciated the honest mention that the shrimp hail from Indonesia. We downed eight oysters in quick succession before savoring the dense, sweet meat from Jonah crab claws. Kimchi, the condiment du jour, found its way into a freeform ceviche of hamachi slices over a slick of tomatillo salsa. The straightforward joys of frilly Maryland crab tossed in light Dijon dressing proved more gratifying.", "As did two cooked dishes. Properly fried Ipswich clams\u2014crisp-chewy, not too greasy, the oceanic equivalent of potato chips\u2014are one of the great pleasures of New England, and Neptune did them justice. And the meal's surprise hit was the johnnycake, a dish that harkens back to European settlers. For its luxury makeover, it was capped with smoked salmon tartare and a thimbleful of California sturgeon caviar and then saturated with melted honey butter. It arrived as an appetizer but it made dessert redundant. And anyway, this isn't a place to linger over sweets. Someone is always anxious for your seat.", "Oyster platter", "While Neptune feels timeless, B&amp;G revels in its mod vibe. Hexagon mosaic tiles cover a wall in groovy shades of chocolate and shale. Chandeliers, covered in glass resembling flowers set in amber, hang over tables with a metallic finish.

They're piled under ice in one corner of the center three-sided bar, where one staffer stands tirelessly shucking.", "But here, a platter of oysters is as much opening salvo as centerpiece. Gulp down a few and then bask in summer with a salad of grilled, sliced peaches drizzled with yogurt and scattered with crumbled feta and golden raisins. Share a plate of golden smoked shrimp beignets, snatched fresh from the fryer.", "Lobster BLT; Lobster roll", "Don't stray too far from the theme, though. Chubby cavatelli sluiced with dried tomato sauce and blanketed with Jonah crab? Pleasant enough. But I'm all in for the fried clams, cleaner tasting even than Neptune's and suitable for gobbling with only a squeeze of lemon. As for the lobster dishes, they will cost you, but they are masterful. The chef touches are subtle in the $29 lobster roll (which comes with fries, house-made pickles, and slaw). Bits of celery and mayo merely perfumed with lemon and garlic keep it homey, and the chives, besides adding their glittery green, infuse a delicate onion nip into each bite. The claw and tail meat tumbles out of a hot dog-style bun. The $30 lobster BLT, with the same accompaniments, could easily be lunch for two. It's a towering act of engineering, with two slices of ciabatta sandwiching a generous mound of lobster salad, which is partly held in place by a lettuce leaf acting as wrapper. Not wanting to concede to knife and fork, I had to attack the thing at angles with two hands. The ripe tomato was splayed at the sandwich's base, and with each bite its juices bled more into the bread, creating a pronounced acidic counterpoint. Ingenious.", "I love the town-and-country sense of place at B&amp;G.

It\u2019s an important component of boat noodles with pork ($9.95), also known as nam tok. The \"boat\" part refers to sampans that ply the waters of Bangkok\u2019s canals, where the dish was invented in 1942. Like floating McDonaldses, they ladle out fast food, in this case rice noodles in a slightly sweet broth darkly flavored with soy sauce and blood, jumbled with sliced pork, pork meatballs, and crunchy pork rind. Blood makes the soup richer. In Bangkok you\u2019d also get some offal, but who\u2019s complaining?", "Above: Drunken noodles with beef and papaya salad. Below: Boat noodles with pork.

For lovers of the color pink, there\u2019s yen ta fo noodle ($10.95), seething with shrimp, shrimp balls, fish balls, squid rings, and frilly white fungus in a  too-sweet chicken broth thickened with bean paste \u2014 which is where the color comes from. If you prefer dry noodles without soup, then bamee phoo moo dang hang may be your thing. Egg noodles something like curly packaged ramen are tossed with thick slices of pork belly and shreds of crabmeat. Handfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro provide verdency in this dish often peddled in Thailand from carts late at night.", "A similar noodle joint with the hippie-sounding name of Plant Love House opened on Elmhurst\u2019s Whitney Avenue near the end of 2014. Competing with a half-dozen other Thai cafes in the immediate vicinity with more predictable menus, it never quite developed the following it needed to succeed. So it boldly picked up and moved to Brooklyn, to the Prospect Heights restaurant frontier of Washington Avenue. Cryptically changing its name to Look By Plant Love House, it mounted a similar noodle-focused menu in a deep space with two cramped dining rooms (sit in the front barroom instead), a premises that had failed as several previous establishments, including a clam bar and an Italian restaurant with Israeli flourishes.", "Nevertheless, the food now is spectacular, perhaps a notch above Pye Boat\u2019s. Boat noodles (guay taio num tok, $11) remain the flagship, here with more piquancy and with blood that seems better integrated into the broth.

If you\u2019ve previously experienced tom yum as a small bowl of forgettable soup served as an appetizer, you\u2019ll sit up and take notice of Plant Love\u2019s rendition.

After the eyes acclimate to the dim room, once a pickled herring factory, it's easier to appreciate the elegant grain of the brown ash wood paneling and the voluptuous forms of the columns built to resemble wine decanters (and, indeed, fitted with discrete stations for beverage service).", "But the design also leaves no doubt about the real atmospheric centerpiece: the kitchen, gleaming all white and steel and viewed through glass.

Alaskan king crab salad rests at the bottom of a V-shaped tumbler filled with enough flowers and herbs to recall a terrarium. The top is sealed with a tuile of flavor-neutral sugar, a modernist fillip that also slyly references Duffy's time at Trio as a pastry chef. Tap on the glass with a spoon and it shatters, adding fleeting crunch to the crab poached in a citrus stock reinforced by sweet-sour calamansi. Trout roe adds pop, cucumber juice lends astringency, and dollops of cream steeped with marigold and lemon mint (also the flowers and herb in the glass) emit an herbal pheromone. It's a feat of a dish that quickens the senses and leaves the diner energized for what's to come.", "The crab is the second course in Duffy's Fauna menu, one of the two prix fixe options the restaurant offers. The other, not surprisingly, highlights Flora. Both cost $205 per person and deliver around 10 to 13 courses\u2014a smaller number than at other tasting menu restaurants of similar cost and ambition, though it didn't take long for the progression to include plates of a substantial size, which I found satisfying.", "The meal began with whimsy. Soon after being seated, a gnarly hollowed log arrived, its bark dotted with indulgent bites: an ear of baby corn paired with the juicy beads of finger limes, a sliver of nutty Iberico ham impaled on a metal skewer, a slice of lady finger banana br\u00fbl\u00e9ed, and a black truffle macaron that packed a sensual wallop. Then came a small jar containing a morsel of cod and filled with smoke. The contents had the milky opaqueness of yogurt, an effect emphasized by the foil wrapper affixed to the top.

The evening's crowning glory was gorgeously marbled beef from Japan's Miyazaki prefecture. Duffy loves this protein and has concocted several stagings for it; this one was in the form of a deconstructed Thai beef salad. Raw and cooked forms of the meat hid among a forest of herbs, romaine lettuce cooked into marmalade, and peanuts both caramelized and pureed. Citrusy tom yum broth, poured tableside, provided the soprano line to the meat's baritone smoothness.", " ", "Peaches in jasmine tea cylinder", "The pastry team stole the show with a peach dessert in a frozen cylinder of jasmine tea. Duffy worked with a mold maker for years to perfect a silicone model that could reproduce the same results night after night. This is the first time the kitchen has used it in a sweet dish, and it was wondrous: Braised and fresh white peaches, cream cheese ice cream, and Champagne foam filled the tea canister, which held its form but could also be easily sliced with a spoon. A lot going on, but the purity of the flavors gave me the same innocent happiness as eating a drippy peach over the kitchen sink.", "Duffy receives ample support from general manager and partner Michael Muser, who leads a pitch-perfect service staff and oversees a beverage program that includes a diverse wine list (more bottles in the two-digits than one would expect) and some pricy but heady teas to end the meal.

The opinions among our group of six differed as we began dissecting the meal outside on the sidewalk right afterward. One person mentioned the awkward lag time before a proper greeting: It was 9:15 on a Saturday when we were seated, and the night's service was at its apex. Brazilian samba bounced overhead. (The playlist soon mellowed to Snow Patrol and then somnambulant jazz.) We sat in the center of the boardroom-gone-glamorous, watching the staff deliver entrees or desserts in synchronized sweeps to other tables, or dole out creamy slivers from the cheese cart. Ten minutes later, when we were beginning to mutter about flagging someone down, a server finally approached us.", "It was a clanging start, certainly. But we eventually received our share of steady, lavished attention. No, for me, the dinner's patchiness started with a friend's plate of hiramasa (yellowtail kingfish) crudo during the first of the prix fixe menu's four courses. It tasted fishy enough that she didn't want to eat it. I took a bite and agreed. The dish also included uni and lardo; the menu didn't list them and it probably should have. Perhaps they're meant to be luxury surprises, but sea urchin and cured fatback are, for many palates, make or break ingredients. And, in this instance, their emphatic presence only magnified the fish's pungency.", "Foie gras with fresh and fried cherries", "It was, of course, a shame we were debating the meal's sundry flaws at all. I clearly caught Menton at a transitional moment. It opened in 2010 in the burgeoning Fort Point district (part of the South Boston Waterfront) as the French-Italian crown glory of the Barbara Lynch Gruppo, which includes eight culinary businesses around the city. Lynch, who won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurateur this year, is one of Boston's most respected chefs, deservedly.

At times the flavor combinations lived up to the visuals. Fresh and fried, almond-stuffed cherries buddied up nicely to a creamy round of foie gras torchon, encircled with duck rillettes and splashed with sherry vinaigrette for sweet-sour contrast. A roasted quail entree most embodied the restaurant's efforts to marry French and Italian cuisines. The plate held ponds of a Ligurian-inspired sauce that melded red wine, chicken livers, foie gras, spices, and yogurt. Chickpea farinata (a small, crisp pancake popular as a snack in Genoa) cradled grilled escargot and was used to prop the bird into various states of repose, like avian Renoir models.", "Parisian gnocchi; Chilled Maine lobster with bean salad", "But for every one dish that clicked, there were two that didn't square. Sometimes it was the composition: The chopped fresh legumes (garbanzos, peas, favas) under chilled Maine lobster had a shade too much crunch, and dots of spiced date puree distracted from the lobster's own natural sweetness. Parisian gnocchi, the version made from p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u00e0 choux and then browned, begged for richness in their leading roll. Instead they were relegated to supporting players\u2014fancy croutons, essentially, among crisp radicchio, chanterelle mushrooms, dabs of chickpea puree, and cherries with pickled mustard seeds.

In both cases Meredith Gallagher, one of this year's Eater Young Guns, leaned in discretely to ask if the guest would like another dish instead. When they both politely declined, our server brought out a complimentary bottle of red wine (we'd already consumed two bottles). He was a man who refused hospitality defeat: His ebullience approached mania, with a level of energy that brought to mind Kathy Najimy's nun character in Sister Act.

The Sasso bird (also a staple at Lowlife), is a red-hued, lean-breasted, slow-growth fowl hatched in Montreal and raised in Pennsylvania. Served in a brief explosion of flaming hay, it's been brined by the kitchen for 42 hours, dried for three days, cooked with steam, and roasted at three different escalating temperatures to crisp the skin and render the fat. It all results in an ornithological analogue to dry-aged beef: the breast, thigh, wing, neck, and drumsticks all burst with haute-barnyard aromas that swing like the 70s from funky to smoky to sweet.

My optimism for any less of a wait, I knew then, had been as masochistic as it was delusional. Chef April Bloomfield and restaurateur Ken Friedman's first venture\u2014the tiny, cluttered, well-funded West Village upstart (Mario Batali and Jay-Z were among the original investors)\u2014imported the no-reservations gastropub from Britain ten years ago.

The scent of potted herbs along the windowsill on the left collided midair with the wafts of garlic from the kitchen to the right. I could not have been happier in that moment than if I were a Disney character at the end of \"Frozen.\"", "  ", "Carrot and avocado salad", "The British and Italian cooking at the Pig has grown more attuned over the years, though no less intense. All chefs worship the holy trinity of salt, fat, and acid, but Bloomfield is a charismatic who speaks in beef tongues. That comes through not just in her most overt dishes, including the famous fried pig's ear with its lash of mustardy lemon-caper dressing. The first dish of our meal was a pureed asparagus soup cloudy with cr\u00e8me fraiche, resembling a picture of earth from space, only green under the swirling wisps. The seasonings were so amped, with the vegetable's taste both heightened and diffused, that each spoonful left us marveling and wanting more.

Sodden pork rillettes with mustard and pickles? No. A salad of carrots and avocado, one of the night's specials? Yes, yes, particularly welcome with its juicy grapefruit segments and a cumin-forward dressing that lifted the ingredients into Moroccan realms. And another special, a subtle braised rabbit leg, emerged as the night's sleeper hit buoyed by a verdant supporting cast of fava beans and fiddlehead ferns. I ordered the burger more for context\u2014the patty that launched a thousand imitators and derivations\u2014but, even in our ground-beef-saturated land, the mix of short rib, sirloin, and brisket topped with strong Roquefort stays mighty in the memory.", "The mix of short rib, sirloin, and brisket topped with strong Roquefort stays mighty in the memory.", "Of course the Pig's very essence makes it as much about drinking as feasting, and the liquid vices tempt from all angles: a Guinness stout or a dry Sorachi Ace saison from Brooklyn Brewery; cocktails like the Commonwealth Cup, a gin and tonic given a broader depth of field with cucumber, lemon, a splash of ginger ale. My chums wanted wine; a ready-to-quaff Brezza Barolo held its own with the food. It was near midnight when we waded through the packed bodies, the Pig oinking as loudly as it was when I first walked in. Amazing how a place so tiny has come to loom so large.", "  ", "Tosca Cafe", "Bloomfield and Friedman have shifted lately into empire-building mode. They're actively looking for another space in New York (with some recent hitches) beyond the four Manhattan restaurants they already run, and there were brief rumors about the duo opening their first venture in Los Angeles. Their western expansion already began early last year when the two took over Tosca Cafe, an almost 95-year-old bar in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood. The smoke-stained joint hadn't served food since the 1950s, and its signature drink, popular during Prohibition, was the coffee-less \"house cappuccino\"\u2014Ghirardelli chocolate and steamed milk with a shot of brandy. Bloomfield and Friedman shelled out $1.5 million to build out a kitchen, restore the old-timey murals, and replace red vinyl booths and stools with crimson leather.", "Tosca's clientele had dwindled before Bloomfield and Friedman came in, but Tosca relaunched in October and the two-hour-plus wait last Saturday night\u2014a week after my meal at the Spotted Pig\u2014felt mighty familiar. (Jostled schedules compelled me there that evening; I've otherwise learned my lesson.) Four of us wedged into the slinky, 45-seat bar before dinner. The new team reinvented the \"house cappuccino,\" now a concoction with Armagnac (a hot ingredient in cocktails this year, I'm noticing), bourbon, ganache made from local small-batch producers Dandelion Chocolate, and organic milk. Fun, though I preferred the herbal-earthy Choke Hold with tequila, Cynar, Carpano Antica Formula vermouth, and Maraschino.", "  ", "Caesar salad", "Bloomfield's menu, in keeping with the North Beach's Italian heritage, looks to the Boot for inspiration. The cuisine isn't a leap for her. She learned her craft at London's River Cafe and spent time in the kitchen of Berkeley's Chez Panisse; both of those restaurants draw heavily from the Italian repertoire. But the first plate to hit our table, cubes of gelatinous oxtail terrine topped with a handful of parsley salad, was pure Bloomfield food: unctuous, saline, acidic, balanced, potent. Sliced red chilies and a flurry of pecorino took the tired Caesar in feisty new directions. The kitchen also gave grilled polenta a fresh look, searing firm chunks until the edges were dark and smoky and tossing them among meaty mushrooms, blobs of mascarpone, and grated Parmesan.", "  ", "Bucatini", "  ", "Lamb ribs", "The three pastas on offer showed unusual restraint. A bowl of linguine with asparagus and green garlic was all springtime and simplicity. Bucatini didn't go overboard with the guanciale and chiles tangled into its tomato sauce.

We didn't order the much-discussed roast chicken for two, nestled on toast smeared with ricotta (it takes an hour to prepare); we finished the meal instead by gnawing down herb-speckled lamb ribs and then sharing a square of tiramisu lightened by a finishing douse of grated orange zest.", "San Franciscans often famously reject outside restaurateurs.

The premises seemed far older, as if it had once been a diner or soda fountain, with composite-stone floors, spaceship light fixtures, and twirling stools along a white-tiled counter. In those days it had a reputation for being the only decent place to eat within walking distance of the Javits Center. Still, despite an eclectic French and Italian menu (with some surprise Swedish twists thrown in around Christmastime), the food was hit or miss, and one was well advised to stick with the steak frites.", "The last chef of Market Caf\u00e9, Giovanni Morales, decided to try to keep the declining institution alive with a different formula. Morales named the new version Oovah and adopted the concept of a wine bar specializing in 100 percent gluten-free food, with a small-dish format and a Latin theme.", "Opening New Year\u2019s Eve, 2014, the over-the-top d\u00e9cor had an improvised feel: You stepped through a blue neon frame into the restaurant to find yourself standing between a double row of potted evergreens. Up ahead, grape vines painted a ghoulish white hung in profusion from the ceiling; a scrim at the rear featured a time-lapse skyline of the city that rippled when anyone came in the front door.

And they tend to be the best things on the menu.", "Pollo guisado ($15), a tart and terrific chicken soup, sports a light tomatillo broth. A wealth of creamy, carby hominy lurks in the depths. Carne guisada ($15) might be its dark-haired fraternal twin, a beef stew with a lacing of cabernet sauvignon, a French flourish that the dish could well do without. The long-stewed tenderness of the beef cubes and the swollen rice at the bottom of the bowl are the real attractions here.", "On a couple of occasions, the kitchen was out of pork tamales, another Guatemalan classic. Instead, a friend and I opted for arroz con chorizo, here spectacularly turned out with homemade jalape\u00f1o sausage and a soup\u00e7on of saffron. While one could have hoped for these Guatemalan dishes to be a bit earthier, one supposes that you don\u2019t want the food to be too funky in any place that calls itself a wine bar. Anyway, the most purely Guatemalan dish is classified as a dessert: rellenitos colcocha ($12), fried ripe plantains filled with black-bean puree. Consider ordering it as an app, because the effect is more savory than sweet.", "Shrimp ajillo and cassava gnocchi", "The wine list runs to 50 bottles (18 available by the glass, at $9 to $25 each), and is dramatically worldwide in scope. Pick one of its quirkier white, pink, or red varietals and you can\u2019t go wrong. One night it was a glass of Garzon sauvignon blanc from Uruguay ($15), a crisp white with a fruity dryness, a perfect match for a shrimp ajillo that beds the pink crustaceans on a coarse garlic puree; on another occasion a sparkling Gruet Rose from New Mexico ($15) was low-key enough to let the delicacy of grilled baby calamari rings shine.", "Other wines come from such diverse places as Israel, the Finger Lakes, Spain\u2019s Basque country, Washington State, South Africa, Australia, and Chile. There are few bargains on the list, though at seven ounces per glass (I brought a measuring cup with me one evening), the pours are generous.", "The balance of the menu is mostly Latin influenced, and the results vary.

Yak meat and yogurt are staples, as are fresh green herbs, wheaten dumplings, mung bean starch, and steamed bread. Since the terrain is challenging, agriculture is all but impossible, and this quintessential fact is reflected in the food. So don\u2019t look for red ripe tomatoes or succulent fruits at Cholsum. Nor is Tibet located along spice routes, so flavorings are limited to the scallions and cilantro that give the cuisine its vibrancy.", "But enough of Tibet\u2019s gastronomic limitations. There is plenty of excitement in mung bean starch alone \u2014 a clear jelly that comes molded into noodles and cakes. Against this slipperiness chopsticks are all but useless. In the French-sounding laphing ($4), railroad ties of the pale and translucent starch are heaped up and an oily red sauce dribbled over the top. The first nibble is cool on the tongue, but then chile flakes light up your mouth. Next the Sichuan peppercorns kick in, like chewing on an electric wire. These peppercorns are a recent addition to the Tibetan spice shelf, the result of migration over the mountain passes to China in the north.", "In spicy phing ($5) the starch is cut into transparent and colorless fettucine, then dumped into a broth zapped with garlic and black vinegar, with chopped green onions and cilantro on top. Phing in soup ($6) is the unspicy counterpart. Both can be had in vegetarian and beef-bearing versions, with beef being the universal substitute for yak at every Tibetan restaurant in the U.S.; somehow, the American yak-farming industry never got off the ground. The empty spaces around LaGuardia might be the perfect place for a yak ranch.", "Laphing mung bean jelly; Below: Tingmo bread and homemade yogurt", "Unfortunately, the beef used at Cholsum is as tough as a rime-encrusted winter boot, so tender-beef fanciers would do well to avoid those dishes that incorporate big pieces of it, such as beef salad, beef chili, and the so-called \"special rice plate.\" Instead, go for those wherein the beef appears in minced form, such as the wonderful sha bhaklep ($7), which almost sounds like Yiddish, but represents a trio of baked empanadas with handsome braided spines, perfect traveling food. Put one in your pocket for the subway ride home.", "Beef also appears to semi-spectacular effect in beef with potato ($9), the only occurrence of spuds on the menu. In a rich chile sauce with a few tiny chunks of meat, this stew is as close as Tibetan food comes to Indian. One can\u2019t help but think of potatoes in this context as a rare and desirable ingredient carried from exotic lands, just as Europeans must have felt about them in the 16th century. Hey, this dish is every bit as good as french fries, I swear!", "The national signature and best-known Tibetan snack is the momo (8 for $6) \u2014 a round, thick-skinned, steamed dumpling with a pucker on top. Four types are available: beef, scallion, beef and scallion, and chicken. At the momo carts a block west, beef is often the only kind available, but at Cholsum, chicken rules. One of the best things on Cholsum\u2019s menu is even simpler than momo \u2014 Tibetan special yogurt ($4). Snowed with crystals of raw brown sugar, and possessing a perfect texture that allows it to pull away in tendrils with every tart and tasty bite, this homemade product is as good as yogurt gets anywhere in the world, mountainous or not.

The prospective guests are milling about, smoking, complaining. \"We were told we'd be next,\" someone shouts. The chef, who's doubling as the de facto bouncer, apologizes, and hands out cards for discounted drinks at Maiden Lane, a hip bar nearby that specializes in hand-canned sardines. \"Do you want to come in and eat or are you still upset?\" the chef asks an unhappy bloke whose table is finally ready. Inside, a projector shows Bollywood movies; staffers sing happy birthday; patrons queue up for the solo restroom; aromas of cumin waft through the air; Fanta-colored cauliflower leaves the kitchen; and waiters, within a minute of your being seated, tell you to help yourself to the beer fridge, a suggestion that's more apt for a frat party than the very good restaurant that Babu Ji is. Just roll with it.", "Your amuse is a single gol gappe, a spherical chickpea crisp filled with yogurt, tamarind, and chile. It collapses in the mouth with all the ease of a communion wafer. The sourness hits first. Then comes the heat. And that's when you walk up to the self-serve beer fridge. It contains 24 varieties of ale, maybe more.", "  ", "Babu Ji's beer fridge", "What's good? \"I only know Kingfisher, an Indian beer,\" the waiter replies. Perhaps beer fridges should come with beer sommeliers. I reach for a McKenzie's cider (hint of sweetness), and a staffer magically appears to crack it open with a corkscrew. Another night, as I'm walking a (floral, citrusy) Tank Farmhouse back to the table, a manager shucks off the cap with his thumb ring. Such impromptu bottle service is Babu Ji's contribution to the New York hospitality canon. Waiters open brewskis with the same diligence that a fine dining captain might pull out your chair or re-fold your napkin. And whenever the capsicum-based pain of the excellent butter chicken sets in, the restaurant empowers patrons to seek relief via the fluorescent-lit ice box and its palliative, intoxicating contents. Right on.", "There is no lack of good South Asian food in the greater New York City area \u2013 from Midtown's Pakistani cabbie buffets, with their polychromatic daals and meats in crimson oil, to Curry Hill's Southern Indian spots, with their shiny, gossamer dosas, to Jersey's City's Gujarati hangouts, bastions of vegetarian bliss, to Flatiron's Michelin-starred\u00a0Junoon, with its crystal clear spices (and high prices). But Babu Ji, perhaps more than any of its peers, deserves credit for making a lot of us excited about Indian food for the first time since Floyd Cardoz opened Tabla with Danny Meyer in 1998.", "Owners Jennifer Singh, and her chef-husband, Jessi, who ran a trio of Indian spots in South Australia before moving to Alphabet City, don't bend the rules as hard as Cardoz; there's no bacon naan or duck samosas. But the food can sometimes boast levels of refinement, balance, and creativity that one wouldn't normally expect at a cramped, noisy, hard-to-get-into hangout where most everything's under $20.", "Babu Ji abides by The Momofuku Way. It espouses a lean menu of ambitious yet affordable fare in a striped-down setting, and it applies that ethos to a cuisine (Indian) whose popularity at times seems limited by the overly formal rooms in which it's served and the never-ending menus that advertise it.", "Potato croquettes (aloo tiki) are not an uncommon Indian dish. Singh, of course, tweaks things a bit, whipping his potatoes to a silkier state, adding a hint of lobster for depth of flavor, and finishing the affair with a fragrant cilantro puree. There you have it, one of New York's finest knishes. Roasted paneer dumplings (they look like giant vegetarian chicken nuggets), evoke the tight balance of flavors one might expect at a Michelin-starred Thai spot like\u00a0Pok Pok: the richness of farmer's cheese is offset by a pool of beetroot yogurt and shards of crisp apple. And then the heat comes, slowly but surely, a product of green chile laced into the crimson sauce.", "That heat grows even stronger in the gobi Manchurian, an Indo-Chinese dish that involves deep frying florets and coating them in an agrodolce chile sauce. Singh, taking a few liberties and winking toward American poultry sensibilities, tops the vegetable with sesame seeds and calls it Colonel Tso's cauliflower. The result is a vegan dish packing tons more flavor than the saccharine takeout mainstay made from commodity chicken. Bonus: Singh tells me he might do an Indo-Chinese pop-up one night, serving Manchurian curries, momos, spring rolls, and Indian spiced noodles.", "Above: Tandoori roasted paneer with beetroot ginger sauce and crisp apple; Below: General Tso's Cauliflower and Tandoori chicken with naan.", "Any meats cooked in the tandoor are precisely what they should be \u2014 hot and juicy \u2014from tender Murray's chicken breasts to barely-cooked-through prawns (with their aromatic heads still attached) to nutmeg marinated lamb chops.", "Tandoori breads balance vaguely charred exteriors with soft, stretchy interiors. Winter paratha is the hidden gem in this category, employing chiles and bitter daikon to keep the natural sweetness of the dough from getting out of hand. Use the bread to snatch up mounds of butter chicken, a dish that too often mimics Campbell's runny cream of tomato soup; here, the gravy is denser, evoking the rich overtones of a Michael White pasta sauce. Or take a swatch of garlic naan and dunk it in a brilliantly sour Punjabi kadhi, a yellow witch's cauldron of yogurt, turmeric, lemon juice, and spinach-onion pakoras.", "Milk curd doughnuts, in an aggressively sweet syrup (as is appropriate, my subcontinental friends assert), is the right pairing for a cup of masala chai, black tea spiked with a warming mix of ginger, cardamom, and fennel seed. And since that beverage is somewhat ubiquitous in concentrate form at corner coffee shops, let me add: Babu Ji's version is better. Also above average is the cardamom kulfi (condensed milk ice cream on a stick); I watch as a lady in a red dress stands and walks outside with the frozen treat in hand, as if the restaurant were simply a booth in a larger state fair.", "One last note: Babu Ji recently switched to a tip-free system, following in the footsteps of\u00a0Bruno,\u00a0Dirt Candy, and soon, all of\u00a0Danny Meyer's restaurants. The house adds a 16 percent administrative fee to every check. \"We pay all of our staff a livable wage,\" the website reads. It's a laudable decision that should ensure a better living for cooks, who often make less than servers and bartenders. But since Babu Ji has taken pains to espouse such a progressive policy, allow me to suggest another avant-garde idea: actually picking up the phone when patrons call up.

This $16 bowlful of sunshine features perfectly cooked crustaceans heaped on chunky yellow grits, around which a flavorful reddish-brown broth swishes. So far, it\u2019s a pure evocation of a famous Southern dish. But The Heyward embroiders on the regular recipe by substituting chorizo for bacon, then nonchalantly tossing some shishito peppers on top. Though decidedly non-doctrinaire, this version is one of the finest the city has seen since Edna Lewis left. (Shrimp and grits was a cornerstone of her 1976 landmark, The Taste of Country Cooking.)", "The Heyward is a year-old Williamsburg bistro in the old Zebulon space. The walls are somber dark green and dark gray. The seats are comfortable and adult-sized; some are even padded. \"Is this place aimed at an older crowd?\" A friend inquired as she scanned the laid-back space, where she saw four divided dining zones, one of which provides stools along a semicircular counter looking into a chef\u2019s work area that is more theater than conventional kitchen. The white-clad cooks therein dabble in the Lowcountry cooking of coastal South Carolina, which is a dangerous enterprise. Many previous New York restaurants have foundered on the rocks of American regional cooking.", "Above: Butternut squash mac 'n' cheese; Below: Hoppin' John and the French toast sandwich", "The restaurant is named after turn-of-the-century Charleston literary figure DuBose Heyward, who wrote the novel upon which Gershwin\u2019s \"Porgy and Bess\" was based. (Less auspiciously, he also penned The Country Bunny and the Good Little Shoes.) In tribute to him, and presumably to Charleston itself, which is currently considered one of the hottest food cities in the country, other South Carolina standards are faithfully reproduced, in recipes developed by original chef Derek Orrell, and partly carried on by his replacement, Kevin Bergh.", "Hoppin\u2019 John ($16) is a dish that traces its lineage back to West Africa, where renditions using black-eyed peas can still be found in Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana. At The Heyward, heirloom field peas and Carolina gold rice from Anson Mills are used, the way Sean Brock does it at his celebrated Charleston restaurants. Additionally, a piece of seared and browned pork belly is laid across the top, in a salute to Brooklyn\u2019s favorite part of the pig. A contrasting dish substituting sunnyside-up eggs for pork belly appears on the brunch menu. Both are worth ordering, with the beans displaying assertive savor.", "Reflecting the seafood-centricity of the Lowcountry, there\u2019s a nice French-leaning oyster service (though a little expensive at $3 per) and a bucket of peel-and-eat shrimp, which taste good but leave your fingers smelling funky. Paradoxically, most of the Lowcountry standards are found in the appetizer and side dish sections of the menu. That\u2019s OK, because it\u2019s easy enough to make a meal out of small plates. In addition to the shrimp and grits and hoppin\u2019 John, one might include the sweet-corn-and-pimento succotash (which is not really succotash, because where are the lima beans?), the fried green tomatoes (they recently disappeared from the menu, but will hopefully reappear once summer returns, or the green-tomato truck rolls in from Florida), and the excellent cornbread, which might be mistaken for fine cake.", "The kitchen at The Heyward", "Yes, the Lowcountry stuff rocks, especially a delightful she-crab soup now gone from the menu, wherein the savory pink broth had been amplified with rich roe and ramified with fine shreds of fresh crab, with purple micro-greens scattered on top. What a picture it made in the bowl! But venture afterwards to the entrees and find yourself on less agreeable terrain far from the Carolina seaboard. The thick pork chop on a gravel of heirloom carrots is tasty enough, but the hanger steak ($27) hides its few sliced pieces in too much salad for the price, and the roasted cod entr\u00e9e is just plain dull. Throw away the fish and eagerly suck down the sauce it comes in, a delicious sweet potato vichyssoise. The yams, at least, would be totally at home in South Carolina.", "Really, if you\u2019re after something in the belt-busting main course category, you can\u2019t do better than The Heyward\u2019s hamburger ($18), which comes capped with very old cheddar and sided with scraggly fries seasoned with Old Bay, fulfilling the divine imperative that every Brooklyn bistro must provide a burger on its menu. Though I don\u2019t usually bother with brunch (broken Hollandaise provokes my gag reflex more certainly than any other substance), I did have a wonderful dish one Sunday morning at The Heyward.

In fact it has more tricked out tools than some tasting menu venues. Too bad the dopest toy of all is out of sight and downstairs, a Meadows Mills stone burr. The machine grinds wheat berries from a collective farm near Ithaca into fresh flour, which is then used to make the restaurant's nouveau-Neapolitan pies. \"I think there is a lot of flavor potential in fresh flour that gets lost in typical AP flour or \u201800\u2019 flour (the gold standard pizza flour) after it has been processed, bleached, bromated, and after it has sat in a warehouse, a boat, or a store shelf for a while,\" co-owner Demian Repucci writes in an email. This extravagance, along with the wood burning oven, was paid for the 2015 way:\u00a0through a $30,000 Kickstarter campaign.", "Repucci, along with chefs Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino, with their nutritional yeast and bee pollen garnishes, really, really, really want you to know they're doing something more exquisite than the other pizza guys. And who can blame them? Pizza, like barbecue, is a white hot foodstuff whose evolution is limited by our own nostalgia, by our allegiance to how we ate it growing up, and by how little we spent on it. Pizza does not yet have its Alex Stupak, a universally recognized subverter, or its Thomas Keller, someone willing to push the refinement factor into the stratosphere.", "Slojkowski and Gulino, who previously ran the set menu Box Kite on St. Marks, are  willing to push the pizza envelope a little harder (haute ranch dressing makes an appearance) and place their pies amid a menu of composed dishes that could alone merit a crowd of destination diners. This is why Bruno, despite its flaws, is the most compelling and creative expression of a pizzeria since Roberta's opened in 2008.", "Here's how to make the most of your experience here:", "[Local squid with hatch chiles and charred onion; corkscrew pasta with smoked bone marrow, clams, collards.]", "Going pizza-only is temping, but that would be a mistake at Bruno where the small plates, which look like curated forest canopies or tidal pools, wouldn't feel out of place at Aquavit or a fancy Danish flower shop. Squid, fortified with an aromatic dose of \"ocean-herbal\" sauce, finds its natural shellfish sugars amped up with slices of smoked and charred onion. Then the hatch chiles hit you. Time for a beer. Fairytale eggplant, roasted to the texture of slow-cooked bananas, derives its sweetness from cashew butter, its verdant bitterness from roasted shishitos. If the chefs put it all on bread, they'd have an A-grade PB&amp;J. And then there's compressed watermelon with lardo, roasted okra, pickled okra, and poblano emulsion, a sweet-sour-spicy-fatty affair that's straight up Paul Liebrandt \u2014 which is to say an outstanding combination of ingredients that no inside-the-box chef would think to put together.", "David Chang, an original gangster in serving high-end (yet affordable) food in cramped, noisy spaces, would be proud of the Bruno boys. Surely no other U.S. restaurant utilizes a more painful counter stool. Designed by Repucci himself, they lack both lumbar and pediatric support. Your feet dangle and knock up against the poorly-spaced bar wall, and I'll bet Air Turkmenistan has more legroom than this. The lighting is cafeteria bright, meaning the environs are more conducive to food photos, less so to first dates, or lingering.", "You don't tip at Bruno, where servers are paid an hourly wage. Such policies are increasingly common at tasting menu spots like Atera and Brooklyn Fare, but still rare at the casual, a la carte level. Amanda Cohen's affordable Dirt Candy is an exception in that regard, and\u00a0Repucci's conversations with Cohen informed his decision to do away with gratuities at Bruno. \"We both agreed that tipping is racist, sexist, etc., and doing away with it seemed the best way to simplify things and potentially pay cooks a little more for all their hard work,\" Repucci says. The fairest way to eliminate tipping is by raising prices, a practice that lets diners know how much they'll spend without having to do any mental math. \"But then our prices would be 20 percent higher than everyone else\u2019s.\" Indeed, a service-included policy would push Bruno's margherita pie from $15 to $18. So instead, the restaurant levies a 20 percent administrative fee, which more or less functions as a mandatory tip. Will Bruno eventually go full-on service-included? \"I think eventually, as more restaurants move to no tipping, the consumer\u2019s pricing perception will change and restaurants will be able to just have higher menu prices,\" Repucci says. Right on.", "  ", "[The margherita pie.]", "The margherita pie, with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil, is too often like a Beatles cover band \u2013 overly faithful to the original. Bruno tweaks things just a bit. Rounds of Caputo Brothers mozzarella sport a welcome, almost toothsome chew. This isn't milky mush; this is cheese, dammit. Then there's the fruit. The chefs use a blend of fermented and canned tomatoes, with the vine itself steeped into the juice, creating a marked pucker and a distinct vegetal perfume that's aggressively headier than standard pies. A whisper of garlic, a hint of dried clay pepper, and a wallop of basil stimulate and sharpen the palate, cleansing it for more pizza eating. This all lies on top of a gently sweet whole wheat crust the thickness of two credit cards, with just a hint of droopiness and \u2013 as is increasingly common in New York \u2013 no Neapolitan-style soupiness. It's as close to margherita perfection as I've encountered in over a decade.", "If it's in season, try the country and peach pie, a clever sweet-savory combination that function as a Southern take on a pineapple-spiked \"Hawaiian\" pie. Or do the salad pie, which employs bottarga-topped, dressing-slicked greens as a samurai sword to cut the sugars of roasted cherry tomatoes and the fat of milky ricotta. Lamb pie, covered in coppa, is a clean expression of farmland funk. Pepperoni pie, in turn, introduces a wild card into the mix: ranch dressing, a high-end take on the fringe movement that involves Americans dunking their hot pizza in cool, spiced buttermilk. At Bruno, the effort is more subtle: the ranch is an elegant finishing touch, something to gently reduce the tang of the tomato, with a clean dill-infusion playing foil the porky sausage.", "[Rose geranium gelato.]", "There's currently just a single offering on the sweets menu: Rose geranium gelato over blueberries and honey. You can skip all the condiments: you're here for the magic of the Pacojet, a Swiss piece of machinery that uses blades spinning at 2,000 RPM to break up any ice crystals in your custard.

But at the southern end of these frugal environs in the Park South Hotel, on a slice of 28th Street that still smells richly of garlic and cumin, you'll find something different: the Big Apple outpost of the Boston-born O Ya, where Cypress Hill plays while patrons consume Japanese Wagyu, where everyone demolishes chocolate-covered foie gras sushi for dessert, and where a sake-paired tasting can cost just shy of $1,000.", "Beverage guru Nancy Cushman and chef Tim Cushman have given New York one of its most expensive new restaurants since Per Se and Masa opened in the Time Warner Center over a decade ago, and they've tucked it into one of the city's most affordable culinary districts. Naysayers will mourn this as yet another example of how unfettered extravagance is spreading through the four corners of our five boroughs, and indeed it would be sad if Hermes outlets started replacing Indian sweet shops in the East 20s. But until that happens, I'll argue that an excellent fine-dining institution (which this mostly is) in an unexpected location can serve as a boon to the community. ", "Thing is, it's not quite clear whether O Ya, with its set-menus and stratospheric prices, is actually making itself accessible enough to welcome (or warrant) a steady stream of regulars (or special occasional diners) from anywhere. So with that in mind, here are five things you need to know before you drop a dime on dinner here.", "Hamachi with banana pepper mousse and foie gras balsamic chocolate kabayki", "O Ya, like the Boston original, is a sedate rectangle of a room, boasting exposed brick walls, a wonderfully eclectic playlist (Gorrilaz, Butthole Surfers, Chicano Batman, Taj Mahal), and a 16-seat walnut bar that's nearly as smooth as those 500-year-old Hinoki wood slabs that certain critics rave about like they're Lamborghinis. Smart diners will ask for seats at that counter and avoid the tables. Sushi, after all, is a performance art, and because each morsel is so small and ephemeral, much of the enjoyment comes from the build-up, from watching a chef slice the cool fish, anneal it, in an almost magical slight of hand, to a mound of warm vinegared rice, and place it in front of the guest. Good raw fish joints are compact enough to allow such spectating and interaction, while at larger ones, the chef will often reposition himself in front of the intended recipients.", "That visual luxury, alas, isn't guaranteed at O Ya. Those sitting at the north side of the counter often won't see anything until a slice of hamachi with banana pepper mousse appears on a plate delivered by the server. It will still be delicious, with the pepper cutting through the fattiness of the rich fish. But it's sushi that's missing half its narrative, an admittedly nitpicky issue that nonetheless feels amplified at these prices. So the key is to request a seat at the south side of the bar, closer to where the action takes place.", "New restaurants typically price themselves a few dollars less than their more experienced peers, as an enticement to hesitant diners and as a general act of deference as they work any kinks of their system. Then there's\u00a0O Ya, which, when it opened in June, instantly become New York's third most expensive sushi spot after Masa and Kurumazushi. It also happens to be pricier than Le Bernardin, New York's most heralded seafood restaurant. That's bold, baby.", "O Ya instantly become New York's third most expensive sushi spot after Masa and Kurumazushi.", "O Ya offers two options, an 18-course menu of sushi, sashimi, and small plates for $185, and a longer 24-courser for $245. That means dinner for two, after tax and tip will run anywhere from $477-$722. Add on pairings and you're at just under $1,000.\u00a0And while that's less than what you'll spend in Boston, where the longer menu is $285, O Ya is still markedly spendier than in vogue sushi spots like Nakazawa ($150) or Shuko ($135-$175). So the million dollar question is whether O Ya is worth it. The answer is: It depends. While the restaurant isn't necessarily more accomplished than its cheaper competitors, it does enough things differently enough, and with enough skill, to merit the attention of any die hard Japanese restaurant aficionado.", "Garlic chive blossom omelette with sweet dashi, wagyu shmaltz", "Chose one of two menus, and after a kumamoto oyster amuse is consumed, nigiri start appearing, most of them flawless. Offerings might include ocean trout with tomato confit (heady and unctuous), squash blossom tempura with scallion oil (firm and onion-y), kohada with oven roasted tomato (tart and oily), or wild spot prawns with yuzu tobiko (with the citrusy roe mimicking the crunch of a shrimp shell). Such creative, seasonal preparations, finished with a tweezer application of thai basil or shiso, and flanked by rice whose marked softness never veers into mushiness, all evoke the more creative approach to sushi long espoused by Gari, Seki, and Nobu, as opposed to the more traditional and minimally-adorned fish purveyed by Ichimura or Masa.", "O Ya's finest nigiri might be its garlic chive blossom omelet, which boasts an unusual whisper of beefiness. That's because the plate is covered in wagyu dust, a white substance that looks like powdered sugar and tastes like dry-aged ribeye. There's your futuristic steak and and eggs.

Then something wonderfully odd happens. The meal switches to composed raw fish dishes, from silky bluefin tuna tataki with smoked pickled onions, to firm kampachi in an incendiary Vietnamese mignonette. The traditional formatis usually the opposite; chefs like to whet the palate with sashimi before sating you with sushi and its stomach-filling rice. \"The meal comes in waves here,\" a waitress tells me, with bites of marshmallow-like kinmadai acting as a post-sushi palate refresher before the heartier tofu and meat courses. Very clever.", "The nice thing about dining at Shuko, just south of Union Square, is that both of its menus are compelling in their own right, a kaiseki experience that follows a series of small plates and hot dishes with an array of sushi, and a more affordable tasting for those who want an even longer parade of sashimi and nigiri and nothing else. They are two distinctly craveworthy experiences.", "If you swing by O Ya, do it right with the 24-course meal", "At O Ya, by contrast, both menus are similar in structure, offering up the requisite luxury items, from bluefin tuna belly, to jiggly foie gras sushi, to seared Japanese Wagyu over potato confit, where the soft steak is essentially your \"butter\" and the heftier potato is your \"meat.\" \u00a0Where things go wrong is that $185 variant, the one that more entry-level eaters might opt for, is too quick, too abbreviated, with just nine or so pieces of sushi and a flurry of sashimi served so rapidly I could see the chef waiting to serve me the next one as I finished the previous course.\u00a0There were no shaved foie gras spoons or shots of tomato shiso kombu water, two of the longer menu's more whimsical intermezzos, nor was there a proper mignardises service, a highlight of the $245 offering. The cheaper menu felt like a concession, an incomplete dinner, a budget tasting menu that still manages to be quite expensive. Ninety minutes after the meal began I was looking at a check. Cost: $300 after tax and tip for one.", "So if you swing by O Ya, do it right with the 24-course meal, with its more leisurely pace and deeper offerings.\u00a0And let's all keep our fingers crossed that the Cushmans might rebrand the $185 option as a sushi-only experience (or introduce a la carte options like in Boston).

The latest area to attract ambitious restaurateurs is upper Broadway north of 145th Street, west of Sugar Hill, in a neighborhood sandwiched between Hamilton Heights and Washington Heights that as yet has no catchy name. Partly partaking of the Parisian boulevard glamor of the Upper West Side, it still remains a bustling Dominican neighborhood, characterized by dollar discount stores and restaurants deliciously specializing in roast pernil. But gradually, upper Broadway is becoming speckled with coffee bars, gastropubs, and ambitious new restaurants.", "A prime example is Bono Trattoria (no relation to the Irish rock star). It was started by a pair of Italians, one from Sicily (Graziella LoBrutto), the other from Umbria (Luca Valeriania). Located in a wide and deep corner space, it previously housed a liquor store with Plexiglas barriers and a fine selection of half-pint pocket flasks. Now, the front and side walls have been flung open to late-summer breezes, the ceiling paved with nostalgic stamped tin, and a wood-burning beehive oven installed mid-restaurant.

(In Greenwich Village, Keste charges $16. Lower rents in disparate locations mean cheaper prices.) Another favorite is fichi ($12), flooded with salty gorgonzola and dotted with pancetta and quartered fresh figs that provide a touch of sweetness and spill their seeds onto the white cheese blanket. Damn, these pizzas are good! Seven more are available.", "Even better than the pizza is a sideline called focaccia ripiena (\"stuffed bread\"), which is like a cross between a calzone and a bar-style quesadilla. The best jams sweet pork sausage and spinach between its puffy and yeasty layers. It's priced at only $8 for four sizeable wedges served in a basket, making a perfect starter. This stuffed pizza is reminiscent of roadside stands in the Umbrian countryside selling flatbread sandwiches called torta al testo. In fact, many dishes on Bono's menu are attributable to the Italian regions the owners came from.", " ", "Inspired by the same region, strozzapreti alla Norcina ($13) is named after the remote village of Norcia in Umbria's far southeastern corner, 42 kilometers over winding mountain roads from Spoleto. The village is known as the hog-butchering capital of Italy, and wonderful salamis, sausages, and cured hams are created there. It is also an area where black summer truffles and porcini mushrooms are found in abundance. All these go together to make Bono's strozzapreti \u2014 twisted double-hanks of noodle whose name translates to \"priest stranglers,\" illustrating the humor often found in Italian food. The al dente pasta is tossed in a truffle cream sauce with crumbled sweet sausage and porcinis, altogether one of the best dishes I've eaten all summer.", "Above: Charred octopus and strozzapreti alla Norcina pasta; Below: The fichi pie", "The other co-owner is undoubtedly responsible for the menu's Sicilian flourishes, including the single wood-oven-charred octopus tentacle that constitutes the most commendable app. Other dishes we might associate with the southern reaches of Italy include eggplant parmigiana; a Sicilian pizza with eggplant, cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella; and fettuccine alla boscaiola (\"hunter's fettuccine\"), a very rich pasta with onions, asparagus, and pancetta in a sauce thickened with eggs. But whatever region is evoked, Bono tends to get the dishes right.", "There are a couple of exceptions, of course. Rather than offering a conventional Caprese salad \u2014 one of the world's most perfect preparations \u2014 Bono gums things up by adding pesto and grilled peaches to the usual ripe tomatoes, mozzarella, and leaf basil. And there's nothing seemingly Italian about the roasted beet salad with herbed goat cheese, which has become so commonplace on bistro menus it only serves to provoke a yawn. The ribeye steak and roast half chicken were substandard, too: the former because it was overdone and not that great a piece of meat to begin with, the latter because it had a reheated mushiness on the day I tried it. Perhaps the menu attempts too much.", "Still, Bono is overall a very good restaurant, especially if you stick with the apps, pizzas, and pastas.

David Chang\u2019s Momofuku empire, while largely a collection eclectic American restaurants, deserves credit in this regard, for introducing a certain class of food-crazed Westerners to the joys of eating lettuce-wrapped pork, and for proving that large-format Korean fried chicken can merit luxury status with a $135 price tag. Then there\u2019s Hooni Kim\u2019s Danji and Hanjan, two trendsetters whose non-GMO meats command sizable crowds and higher prices than the cheaper commodity fare one finds in certain K-town restaurants. And the fact that the two-Michelin-starred Jungsik is still open proves that at least some folks are willing to spend $180 on Korean tasting menus.

Located on the ground floor of MoMA in Midtown, The Modern was where one could enjoy a cocktail or a small plate for less than the twenty bucks it cost to visit the museum. Even if a longer tasting could run hundreds, there was something refreshing about an entry-level culinary experience being more accessible than an entry-level art experience \u2013 in the same building, no less. The Modern wasn't a captive audience institution designed to shake down gallery-goers with overpriced panini; it was an independent establishment, with no entry fee, designed to bring in guests who might not have visited a museum in the first place. And now, eleven years later, as the city's gastronomic and artistic centers of gravity have shifted downtown, Meyer has scored with another affordable museum eatery, this one in the Meatpacking District. Welcome to Untitled at the newly-relocated Whitney.", "The folks to thank here are Michael Anthony,\u00a0who also runs Meyer's Gramercy Tavern, and chef de cuisine Suzanne Cupps.

A snack for two \u2013 a glass of muscadet, a beer, a pickle plate (with stunning curried cauliflower ribs), and a lemony lobster toast \u2013 will cost less, after tax, but before tip, than two $22 tickets to the museum.

But the Piano-designed Untitled, with its sloping ceilings and never-ending glass walls, is a close second. Guests sit in plush Eero Saarinen chairs (about $1,500 retail) while overlooking a down-the-block line of people waiting to get into the museum; it's as if Piano is saying that in the Meatpacking District, the well-heeled street denizens are the real sculptures worthy of observation. The room and the vistas, incidentally, are a heck of a lot prettier than the Whitney itself, which looks like a well-polished 1980s Xerox machine.", "Here's a quick list of dishes that wouldn't be out of place at even an upscale museum restaurant: burgers, sandwiches, fries, or steaks.

He gives us chamomile-infused peas with favas, a whisper of summertime sugar, or matzoh-thin flatbread anointed with bacon and creamed corn, a heavier dose of vegetable-based sweetness. He takes beets with yogurt, a fairly run-of-the-mill pairing, and turns the ingredients into an epic cold borscht of sorts; the addition of pickled cherries, sweet cherries, currants and tarragon evoke a fragrant summer evening in the Russian taiga.", "Above: Roasted and fried chicken and swordfish with eggplant and basil seed vinaigrette; Below: The bar at Untitled", "This is a kitchen that knows how to indulge. Island Creek oysters are fried so delicately that the texture is akin to an oceanic water balloon, ready to burst with brine.

Note to other beverage directors around the city: If you want to encourage novice oenophiles to drink more off-the-beaten track wines, this is how to do it. And here it's worth mentioning that while good restaurants rarely sell more than a bottle or two of Champagne at $100 or less, Untitled, taking a cue from sister spot Marta, offers eleven in that range, including a lean, mean, 100 percent pinot meunier (Christophe Mignon) for $69.", "", "Unlike the rest of the menu, the main courses are more traditionally portioned in the American-style, acting as de facto one-plate meals.

Better are the cubes of swordfish over roasted eggplant; take away the delectably oily flesh and the dish would still boast a breathtaking degree of complexity, with a tomato saffron vinaigrette lending a floral counterpoint to the smoky nightshade. And the chicken \u2013 Anthony uses an insanely flavorful Green Circle breed \u2013 is the game-changing protein here; the\u00a0breast is roasted on the rotisserie, imparting the skin with a funky, pliable softness, while the soy-and-garlic marinated thighs are fried, evoking a masterful, Japanese-style karaage.", "Chamomile panna cotta with honey and berries", "Vegetable-centric restaurants don't need to push squash pudding or tomato souffl\u00e9\u00a0for dessert, but like at any good culinary establishment, the sweet and savory kitchens should at least be speaking the same language, and that's not necessarily the case at Untitled. The postprandial treats of Miro Uskokovic, unlike the innovative fare of chef Anthony,\u00a0can feel as generic as a pair of khakis at Georgetown University. Cake, be it the peanut butter blueberry variety or chocolate fudge, wouldn't be out of place at any airport restaurant, anywhere in America. And poundcake with strawberries is no better than the supermarket version you could make at home.

And yet Anthony's mostly-toast menu (cue eye rolling) is as awesome and affordable as anything one might encounter at a cool East Village establishment.\u00a0Everything's an essay in balance. Cucumbers inject a dose of watery freshness into buttery avocado toast. Green tomato jam imparts acidity to rich cheddar toast. Spicy Thai pickles cut the sweet density of honeyed peanut butter toast. And summery tomatoes, in a more traditional preparation, take the edge off the tartness of goat cheese. They're all $12 each and you enjoy them on the elevated outdoor deck, with its stunning vistas of One World Trade, the Hudson, and The Empire State Building. It's the type of food, and the type of view, that'll alone justify the museum's $85 yearly membership.

The seasonings are simple: salt, pepper, and a touch of turbinado sugar, creating a mind-bending effect that\u2019s essentially the savory analogue of dipping a pretzel in chocolate. If that's too much protein, the lamb belly also comes as part of a banh mi for a more balanced affair; the meat contains enough fat that it squishes down like the traditional p\u00e2t\u00e9 filling, a heady counterpoint to the mess of cilantro, chiles, and pickled slaw that anoints this Southwest-meets-Southeast Asia sandwich.", "This is all the masterful work of Bill Durney, a man who doesn\u2019t need a large Linkedin profile to recount his previous culinary exploits because, well, he doesn\u2019t really have any.

Same goes for the Korean pork ribs, which are smoked and fried, and which don\u2019t exhibit the wimpy, fall-off-the-bone tenderness as Hometown\u2019s mediocre spare ribs; instead, they boast a firmer, meatier chomp. The musk of the Heritage swine is powerful, but tempered by a salty-sweet sugar glaze.

Wu justifies the pairing by talking about how Polish-Ukranian sausages are making their way into Northern China, but the better reasoning is that it just tastes good.

That\u2019s not to say it hasn\u2019t evolved and improved; new items (like green curry snails) appear on the menu with regularity; the restaurant added a serious cocktail program about six months into its run (try the kaffir lime daiquiri); and the kitchen now serves brunch on the weekends, for those who worship at the altar of that controversial and dubious meal. Still, those are just tweaks.", "The larger point is this: In an era when established restaurants are justifiably upping their game by revamping their menus (like at Mission Chinese or Empellon Cocina) or by pushing us even further outside of our comfort zones with longer tastings (like at Contra, Fung Tu, and Thirty Acres), it\u2019s reassuring that other ambitious venues are still packing in crowds by holding the course.

To make a healthy profit margin on a bowl of ramen, Chang once told me that he\u2019d have to charge around $21. \"But I can\u2019t do that, because people would freak the fuck out,\" he said. And to this day, his noodles top out $16. The spendiest ramen at Mu, by contrast, is the $18 oxtail and bone marrow extravaganza.

Indeed, tonkotsu is among the most labor-intensive broths to make, as it involves bringing the bones to a violent boil for over 20 hours, a process that causes them to disintegrate and release not just their gelatins but their minerals and proteins as well, turning the broth cloudy, and imparting a silky mouthfeel.", "It\u2019s that mouthfeel, a strong presence in all four of Smookler\u2019s ramens, that helps Mu stand out among the city's current crop of nascent noodle joints.

But is it? Gaston Acurio, Peru's most famous chef, belly flopped here at his high-end La Mar Cebicheria, shutting it down after less than two years. But long before Acurio, New York City possessed a decent collection of small, inexpensive Peruvian cafes aimed at immigrants and rotisserie chicken joints targeting the general population, both mainly found in Queens. Now along comes Jora, a Long Island City gastropub with a concept poised between fancy restaurant and budget caf\u00e9. Is Bourdain right, and can Peruvian cuisine succeed in attracting an enthusiastic citywide clientele?", "Named after a strain of Andean corn used to make a fermented beverage called chicha, Jora is located just off Jackson Avenue near the Pulaski Bridge, which funnels traffic from Brooklyn to Queens. Think of the neighborhood as Greenpoint North. A friend and I stumbled on Jora after being told there was a two-hour wait at nearby Mu Ramen. We forged inside to discover a waiting area outfitted with plush couches and a pair of dining rooms sumptuously adorned with gilded Inca motifs. A line of Indian pottery lurked in niches up near the ceiling, making us feel like we were raiding a Pre-Columbian tomb. At the end of the dining rooms we found a rather luxurious bar. When was the last time you perched on a bar stool that had a back, let alone thick padding?", "Beef heart anticuchos", "Looking for snacks before our ramen meal, our next pleasant discovery was Jora's extensive menu of appetizers. Fourteen in all, they included many of the things Bourdain had encountered as Peruvian street food. Anticuchos ($9) were a pair of ruby-red veal-heart brochettes \u2014 not minuscule morsels, but hefty chunks tender enough to remind you that, like steak, the heart is a muscle. Marinated in chile paste, the symbol of bovine love had a vinegary tang with a touch of cumin and came with enough sides to be mistaken for an entr\u00e9e.

If you want to amplify the full-meal properties of this seafood collection, order jalea instead: the same assortment breaded, fried, and presented with planks of yuca, in what is probably Peru's most popular bar snack. Even before Jora appeared, you could see jalea being munched in taverns up and down Roosevelt Avenue.", "The starter of octopus squirted with a curious lavender sauce, though, was dull enough to make us scream, which once again suggests the main problem of a gastropub like Jora: the owners don't trust the general public to like chili peppers as much as they do. This can be easily remedied with aji panca, a yellowish chile paste that is readily provided if you ask for it. At least one app doesn't need the hot sauce: rocoto relleno ($9), a portly red pepper stuffed with ground beef, raisins, and hardboiled eggs, a real peasant classic you could eat for breakfast every day.", "Above: Inside Jora; Below: stuffed hot pepper and octopus with olive cream", "If you've read this far, you deserve to know that the best starter of all is a dish popularized by Gaston Acurio himself, which lingers here on the shores of Newtown Creek like the ghost of La Mar Cebicheria. Tiradito ($13) is a wildly generous serving of sea bass cut in thick slices and laved in a spicy citrus sauce; it glows like a jumpsuit on Orange is the New Black.

Still, at $60, it's a decent enough introduction to the pricey ingredient.", "Tripe: Why does it taste so tripe-y?

One of the most delicious things on the menu is arnabeet mekle ($7), an oil-moistened heap of fried, copper-colored cauliflower decorated with fronds of flat-leaf parsley, making what might be a dull side vegetable sing.

But what our own city's culinary scene needs right now is an increased tolerance for creativity and risk, and that's why All'onda is so vital.", "Update: An earlier version of this story stated that All'Onda was on the same block as Gotham Bar &amp; Grill, which is located on 12th Street.", "Email Ryan at sutton@eater.com and follow him @qualityrye.", "Photography: Nick Solares", "22 E 13th St, New York, NY 10003", "212-231-2236", "by Robert Sietsema,Dec 6, 2016, 2:59pm EST", "by Ryan Sutton,Nov 30, 2016, 4:14pm EST", "by Ryan Sutton,Nov 16, 2016, 4:53pm EST"], "title": "Restaurant Review: All'Onda"}{"date": "Jun 24, 2014, 10:15am EDT", "url": "http://ny.eater.com/2014/6/24/6202785/ivan-ramen-is-so-good-it-will-make-your-eyes-explode", "content": ["by Ryan Sutton, June 24, 2014 ", "On July 17, 2012, Ivan Orkin, perhaps the only Long Islander to become famous for running a duo of Tokyo ramen joints, hosted a one night pop-up at Momofuku Noodle Bar in Manhattan's East Village. The doors unlocked at 5:30 p.m. and shortly after 6 p.m. I was told there would be no more Ivan-brand ramen left because half the city, apparently plagued by a mid-summer flu pandemic, thought it would be smart to order hot soup on a 91 degree day. Sure, the sell-out was part hype (and part damnation of strict seasonality), but it also showed that New Yorkers wanted better Japanese noodles \u2014 and more of them.", "Now, two years later, the Big Apple is well into the throes of a ramen revolution and helping to lead the charge is Orkin himself, with a sit-down restaurant on the Lower East Side and a leaner pay-before-you-eat outpost on the Far West Side. And amid our glut of good gluten, you can pretty much walk into either without a wait, though we'll revisit that statement come December.", "This is all good news because the full-service Ivan Ramen on Clinton Street, at just six weeks old, is already slinging out some of New York's most enjoyable noodles as well as a slew of righteous small plates. Case in point: Orkin lets diners wrap sheets of nori around morsels of slow cooked pork, roasted tomato, and sushi rice. Believe me when I say that if the $450 per person Masa ever wanted to drum up more business it could do so by putting these umami grenades on the menu. They cost $6 for two.", "But before we get too involved with all this deliciousness, it's worth dwelling on the awesomely short queue a bit longer because really, waiting two hours for ramen makes about as much sense as booking a spot at your local slice joint a month out. Ramen, however underpriced it might be \u2014 a $15 entree whose complex components require a heck of a lot more effort to make than a $59 steak \u2014  is still spur-of-the-moment \"I'm hungry\" food. And given the vast quantities of salt and fat you're ingesting, sometimes a three-hour tasting menu's worth of calories in a single bowl, perhaps it's best not to think too much about it at all.", "Though it can be hard not to. Take Orkin's outstanding spicy ramen, a mix of dashi, chiles, and chicken broth, all studded with bits of pork and toothsome rye noodles. It sounds simple and the texture is rustic but it has the depth of flavor you'd expect from a fancy French sauce that some guy spent half his life learning to make. And then there's the heat, which lights your GI tract ablaze like a Roman candle going off in both directions. I dare you to eat it on a first date.", "Or consider the triple-garlic mazemen, a style of whole wheat ramen where the ratio of broth-to-noodle is closer to Italian pasta than a can of Campbell's. Orkin roasts and distills his garlic to such a level of sweetness that Mark Ladner could sell this perfectly al dente dish at Del Posto for twice as much and no one would blink an eye. But since the world deems this delicious product to be cheap, Orkin charges just $15.", "No, none of this is terribly revolutionary, not here at least. While Orkin rose to fame in Tokyo by breaking the rules, he's now competing in a city that excels in just that, where great traditional noodles co-exist with very good Americanized ramen. There's Dassara in Brooklyn, which spins a gnarly \"deli ramen\" out of what's essentially matzoh ball soup. There's Ippudo in the East Village, which produces a tonkotsu so milky I'm certain each bowl results from putting an entire wild boar's worth of fat through a commercial juice press. There's Benkei on Delancey, where the chef won't let you order his fine seafood ramen (or anything else) until well after midnight. And of course there's Momofuku Noodle Bar, where David Chang sells a vegetarian chickpea creation that might just be the single most revolutionary ramen dish in New York right now.", "So what makes Ivan Ramen vital in this competitive environment for starch and soup? Its ability to bridge the gap between the new and the old and deliver on both sides of that coin with solid service. Orkin can slay you with his shio (salt) or shoyu (soy sauce) ramen just as much as he can with that garlic mazemen, a flavor so distinctive it should be eligible for the same trademark protection as a Cronut.", "The best seats are at the counter, where you'll see the cooks working away. Look above them for a backlit comic strip, with a woman, a cowboy, and a happy monster all slurping up noodles. There's also an outdoor garden and it can fill up quickly \u2014 New Yorkers won't be denied their al fresco eats even if it means sweating into their soup.", "The ramen takes time to come out (as it should) so start with something cold and sour. Chinese broccoli with sweet soy pickled garlic will get the job done just fine, as will XO pickled daikon, with spaghetti-like strands of the radish coated in scallop chile oil and bits of dried shrimp. The flavor profile is fresh but it should also be salty and funky, which it is not, and that brings us to one of the quirks of Ivan Ramen: Orkin has an occasional tendency to dial down strong flavors.", "Thousand-year-old eggs, a Chinese dish where eggs are preserved in ash and lime for months, are traditionally valued for their pungent, sulphuric aromas. Here at Ivan, the delicacies are deviled and taste as neutral as that suburban American staple. Fried chicken livers and hearts are a fine study in crispy, snappy textures, but the meat is bland; there's no irony punch here. The milder approach works better for scrapple, a Pennsylvania Dutch breakfast meatloaf known for its restrained organ-meat overtones. Orkin nails that flavor profile dead-on, pressing pork shoulder, chicken liver, and buckwheat into a savory, offaly waffle, with bits of apple and maple mayo keep the richness in check.", "Things get more turbo-charged with the ox tongue, whose assertive, rated-R beefiness needs the accompanying hot mustard and soft broth to keep things PG-13. Fried shrimp, often an ode in taste and texture to Amazon.com's packing materials, is 100 percent maritime bliss at Ivan Ramen, with the squirty heads still attached for sucking, and shrimp powder added on for oompf. And kudos to Orkin for amping up the oceanic aromas to 11 with his ankimo dirty rice, a gorgeous platform for the gentle sting of scallion and the high-tide tang of warm monkfish liver. It's a brilliant study in surf and earth.", "Now it's time for the noodles. One of my well-fed dining companions, a musician who refers to himself as a \"ramen whore\" perhaps said it best: \"The shio and shoyu are classic and can be taken down in a heartbeat.\" I pass along that comment because you might see certain ramen experts with no concern for their blood pressure slurping down two bowls at once in 10 minutes flat (to enjoy the broth at its hottest and to avoid overcooking the noodles) \u2014 I'm more of a half-a-bowl in 20 minutes type of guy. If anything, I'll argue the shio tastes better when cooler, as it allows the bonito it's made with to shine through more clearly.", "Shoyu, in the earlier days, had the color of molasses and all the daydream-inducing complexity of the soy sauce it was made with. But Orkin now uses a lighter product with a shallower flavor. It's not bad, just not as good. Triple garlic, shio, and spicy chile ramen are the smartest moves here, while the four cheese mazemen is a fine Japanese carbonara of sorts, with nutty asiago and rich pork.", "Orkin tells me lunch will debut in July and that he eventually has plans to roll out some of the more expanded selections of noodles he offers in Tokyo \u2014 like a variety of tsukumen dipping ramen. There's no dessert here \u2014 Orkin says he's still \"tossing around\" that idea \u2014 and the lack of sweets of course helps him turn over tables more quickly. In the meantime, a friendly waiter recommends you saunter over to il Laboratorio del Gelato, where the wait, incidentally, might be longer than at Ivan Ramen; I suppose that makes a certain amount of sense in June to normal people, if not to food people.", "Email Ryan at sutton@eater.com and follow him @qualityrye.", "\rPhotography: Nick Solares\r", "25 Clinton St, New York, NY ", "by Robert Sietsema,Dec 6, 2016, 2:59pm EST", "by Ryan Sutton,Nov 30, 2016, 4:14pm EST", "by Ryan Sutton,Nov 16, 2016, 4:53pm EST"], "title": "Ivan Ramen Is So Good It Will Make Your Eyes Explode"}{"date": "May 27, 2014, 9:30am EDT", "url": "http://ny.eater.com/2014/5/27/6217733/restaurant-review-ecuatoriana", "content": ["by Robert Sietsema, May 27, 2014 ", "For those accustomed to the comically tiny and expensive servings of ceviche tendered in bistros, seafood restaurants, and small-plate places, the Ecuadorian product will come as a shock. This South American republic is one of three places said to have invented ceviche (the other two are Mexico and Peru), and in its highlands, coastal lowlands, and interior jungles, ceviches appear as giant collections of seafood swimming in vast pools of citrus. Ecuadorian menus in New York often translate the term as \"cold soups.\"", "At Ecuatoriana, a classic Ecuadorian diner in Harlem's Hamilton Heights, the ceviches are so voluminous, you can treat one as an entire meal, or as an appetizer shared among several friends. There's no better summer dish in town \u2014 low in calories, refreshingly cool, and gluten-free.", "Of six varieties offered, most luxurious is ceviche mixto con concha negra (mixed ceviche with black clam, $18). The principal components are perfectly cleaned and deveined shrimp, chunks of corvina (a white-fleshed fish wildly popular in South America), octopus tenderized to within an inch of its young life, and concha negra, or black clam. Known to marine biologists by the alarming name of Anadara tuberculosa, this shellfish is traditionally found among the mangrove swamps around coastal Guayaquil, and reputed to be a powerful aphrodisiac. Schwing!", "Neon lobster sign; ceviche", "The swart bivalve deeply colors the ceviche, and you'll find yourself fishing in the black lagoon of your bowl for tart shreds of purple onion, chunks of ripe tomato, and fronds of cilantro \u2013 which jolt the soup like an electric current \u2013 in addition to the solid seagoing parts. As if that quantity of food were not enough, ceviches come with a side of polished white rice or crunchy corn nuts, which may be dumped into the soup to vary the aquatic terrain. Who could go back to tiny swatches of seafood napped in a teaspoonful of fruit juice after tasting this?", "While most Ecuadorian restaurants in town tend to be tiny holes-in-the wall in Queens or Brooklyn with counter seating and perhaps a table or two, Ecuatoriana is gigantic, boasting a pair of high-ceilinged dining rooms clad in lacquered brick separated by a monumental arch. A dozen chandelier fans spin madly at all times, and a few Christmas ornaments calculated to put you in a party mood hang from the ceiling on long strings. The front room flaunts an actual lunch counter which functions as a juice bar, and a red neon lobster burns in the front window \u2013 even though there's no lobster anywhere on the menu. Other than neglecting the roast guinea pig known as cuy, every other classic Ecuadorian dish is found on the bill of fare.", "If you've become fond of the corvina in the ceviches, you may want to try it fried. A platter of two foot-long filets, ever so lightly breaded and cooked to crispness, will set you back $13. Accompaniments include slices of ripe avocado; the fried, smashed, and fried-again woody plantains sometimes called tostones; and an undressed green salad that unfortunately contains discouraging quantities of fusilli. Still, the platter is a rollicking good deal, enough for two to share.", "In fact, all the entr\u00e9es at Ecuatoriana are big, which suggests you bring a crowd and pass the plates around. King of the big feeds is the bandeja paisa ($13), which translates to something like \"national tray.\" It features a large chorizo split longitudinally and grilled, and a mass of top-round steak, sliced wafer-thin. This multiplies the caramelized surface area of the well-done meat. In a country where the cattle are muscular from climbing up and down the mountains and expensive, too, the thin-slicing is economical and makes for a tenderer chew.", "Orbiting the steak and sausage like indistinct planets, find a llapingacho \u2013 a fat potato patty colored yellow with annatto and stuffed with cheese, an ingredient that's one of the few happy legacies of the Spanish Conquistadores. There's a sculpted mesa of rice with a carrot cross on top, as if constituting a high-altitude helicopter landing pad, a mess of white navy beans, a fried egg with a gooey yolk that threatens to inundate the rest of the platter, and that damn fusilli-bearing green salad again.", "There are plenty of meal-size soups, too, served with rice or corn nuts at your request. The sopa de mariscos is a tomatoey tour-de-force containing a similar selection as the ceviche mixto, while the caldo de gallina is a tough old hen stewed with vegetables to total tenderness. On the weekends, an expanded roster of soups include the frankly weird caldo de bola \u2013 a vegetable soup sporting a brown globe in the middle. Inside the dumpling is a combo of ground meat and boiled egg, which spills out into the soup the minute you cut into it. There's a wonderful caldo de pata (\"cow-foot soup,\" $10), too, which might remind you of the tonkotsu broth used in Japanese ramen; it's gooey and gluey and good for your complexion via the dissolved collagen.", "Many of the most desirable and unusual dishes are weekends-only, but it doesn't hurt to request them on the other days of the week, when they may appear at random. I loved guatita ($11), a fricassee of honeycomb tripe and potatoes thickened with a turmeric-laced peanut sauce. The patches of digestive tissue are glove-like and not at all skanky, while the spuds are so overcooked they recede into the sauce. The recipe is considered the country's foremost hangover remedy.", "In fact, a lion's share of the menu at Ecuatoriana incorporates potatoes in some form or other, reminding us that Ecuador and its surrounding Andean countries can boast over 3,000 varieties\u2014a testament to the region's impressive biodiversity.

A grid in the window displays the entire menu in 22 color photos, including several stews (called \"sauces\") paired with polished rice, boiled yams, or foutou; a pair of whole-fish platters; plus fried and jerked chicken, which are intended mainly as a come-on to non-West-African patrons.", "", "The interior of the restaurant is deep and high-ceilinged, boasting a broad white counter at the rear that looks like the check-in desk of a modestly priced roadside motel. For some unfathomable reason, a string of holly with red berries runs along one wall up near the ceiling, while another wall is devoted to a rack of gangsta-themed videotapes from Jamaica and Nigeria. A large TV at the front of the house alternates mournful international news with Ivory Coast hip-hoppers wearing animal-print dashikis, backed up by gangs of undulant female dancers not quite in step. The proprietor will come around the counter to greet you, brandishing menus like the one in the window, only smaller and protected by plastic.", "Fully enjoying the city's West African eateries takes some practice. You must throw away many of the assumptions you usually bring to a restaurant meal. At Abidjan, after examining the menu, one must begin by asking the jolly, gray-haired proprietor what dishes are actually available that day. Chances are it will be only four or five. In many West African restaurants, the menu is considered a speculative document, generally listing every dish the cook can think of, even ones she has no intention of making. At least the menu gives you a good idea of what constitutes everyday fare for the average Ivory Coast citizen. Without as much meat, of course.", "Your implied social contract with this type of restaurant guarantees you'll be fed a delicious, abundant, inexpensive, and perfectly prepared meal \u2014 not that you'll be able to fully exercise your dietary preferences. In this regard, Restaurant Abidjan resembles the earliest European restaurants, medieval lodgings where the innkeeper felt obliged to feed weary travelers, but only offered a single meal assembled at his whim. Yes, Abidjan will feed you well, but you can never be sure what.", "Toss away the idea of courses, too. There are no desserts. There no sides or apps, either, though a plate of sweet fried plantains ($6), enough for three to share, can function in a pinch as a starter, side dish, or even dessert. Also don't expect much in the way of beverages, though a pint of ginger or sorrel punch ($3.50) made with pineapple juice is often available. Leaving a burning sensation on the lips, the ginger is especially recommended. But the restaurant devotes so little attention to stocking beverages, your best bet is Mexican or Japanese beer from the Palestinian bodega a block east. Hooray for BYOB!", "So what should you expect to eat at Restaurant Abidjan? If you're lucky, the peanut sauce ($7) will be available. It's like a liquid peanut butter sandwich, though one that has meat bobbing in it \u2013 either lamb, oxtail, or chicken, depending on the mood of the cook. Order foutou to go with it. This is a mash made of plantain flour, notable for its bouncy texture and plainish flavor. Nip off a piece with your thumb and forefinger and dip it deeply in the sauce, then close your eyes and chew. There are other mashes, too, including placali, an oblong wad of fermented yuca with a sour taste, said to satisfy hunger longer than milder mashes. Other alternatives include a plain plate of polished white rice, and something called tomato rice ($5), which is a moist morass of grain soaked in red sauce with some mixed vegetables thrown in, tasting like something you might find in a Spanish or Mexican restaurant.", "Sporadically available are okra, palm-oil, eggplant, and chicken sauces ($7 each). The okra provides a lesson in mucoidal viscosity, and every friend I've taken to taste it has fallen immediately in love. If nothing else, the sauce demonstrates a familial connection between Louisiana Creole and West African cuisines. The palm oil sauce is reminiscent of the kind of canned meat gravy you might ladle over your instant mashed potatoes in Mid-America.", "The dish presentation is refreshingly rudimentary. Grilled lamb ($7) is three good-size chops accompanied by nothing but a pool of the same tomato relish we've seen before. Paleo dieters take note. Something you shouldn't miss once you've tried the peanut and okra sauces is the national dish: a fried whole snapper, head on, accompanied by attieke (pronounced \"ah-check-ay\"), a tart stodge of fermented manioc meal that looks like white couscous. As with the sauces and mashes, you must buy the components of the meal separately ($12 and $3, respectively).

Or put more succinctly: Pok Pok is a prime example of how good restaurants often need a year or two to get their act together. So sometimes we critics give them a re-review. This is one of those times.", "Not that anyone ever expected anything less from Ricker. The dude, a Vermont native, made a name for himself at his flagship Pok Pok in Portland, Oregon, serving his take on the fragrant food of Northern and Northeastern Thailand. \"I'm not a chef. I didn't invent this stuff\u2026I'm a proud copycat,\" he writes in his cookbook, which you should read cover-to-cover before you eat at his restaurant, just as if you studied The French Laundry Cookbook before you dropped $700 at Per Se back in 2004.

That means it's funky. I dig it.", "Smart guests will start with that treat as well as with the hand minced swine salad, an addictive mix of ground pork, cracklings, fried garlic, mountain cilantro, and just enough long pepper to make your brow sweat. I watched in awe as a friend who recently got back from Southeast Asia consumed this the traditional way, using pockets of sticky rice to snatch up the meaty morsels with her hands, the cheaper starch acting as an edible implement to extend the flavor of the more expensive pork.

The milk-fed meat recalls the soft texture of sweetbreads; the exterior boasts an audible crunch; and the flavor is pure butter and olive oil.

The wonderful double-entendre of a name either refers to a fancy vineyard in Burgundy or the unwanted product of extra-marital monkey business. No more 16-course tastings like at Corton, just set menus at $55, $65, and $75 for two, three, or four courses.", "Poussin schnitzel", "Winterman, who will try to sell you cheeses smuggled in from abroad at multiple points throughout the evening, is a partner in the venture, as is Austrian-born chef Markus Glocker, a Gordon Ramsay vet.

The original chef was David Bouley and the goal was to serve high-end French fare in a slightly more relaxed environment (and at lower prices) than the old-school \"Le's\" and \"La's\" Nieporent used to work at. \"Affordable French restaurants are as rare as air-conditioned subway cars,\" Bryan Miller wrote in his three-star New York Times review of Montrachet, and he praised the $16 prix fixe as \"one of the better deals in town.\" Montrachet also offered a $26 set menu, which works out to $57 in inflation adjusted dollars, just $8 off from Batard's current three-courser.", "Batard isn't as groundbreaking or exciting as either of its predecessors.

It's a brilliant dish where the line between sweet and savory is so brilliantly blurred the salad could easily function as a dessert with just a hint more fruit.", "Sometimes the creativity goes overboard. Poached oysters with pickles are fine starters on their own, though it's not clear why each shell is garnished with a knob of fried pigtail. Pork and shellfish is a classic combination (chowder!) but the addition of the crispy swine complicates what could have been a one-bite affair. And while rabbit with flavors of bouillabaisse results in an excellent saffron-heavy soup, substituting the dish's traditionally rich fish for one-note hare is questionable.", "Pro Tip: Ask for a table closer to the bar for a more tolerable noise level. The sound-absorbing carpets and tablecloths of Corton are gone, and even with a bit of soundproofing newly installed, Batard's decibel levels can still strain the ears.", "But such an inconvenience doesn't mean Nieporent has fully embraced the stripped-down ethos of our budget gourmet era. Riedel wine stems are thin and tall; good Laguiole and Christofle knives inspire thoughts of flatware robbery.

But what makes the dish approach greatness is the accompanying bowl of honey-roasted gravy. The flavor is deep, round, and rich at first, then gives way to a restrained sweetness.", "Indeed, there are few other savory chefs who deploy sugar with such aplomb as McInnis and Booth. They tone down the vegetal notes of mashed parsnip with a gentle maple sauce. They take a Kurobuta pork chop and inject a world of flavor into it with a heady peach-bourbon syrup. It almost veers into cloying territory until the sting of chili shocks the palate back into order, and a soft nugget or two of pork belly adds a musky uppercut.", "That 18 oz chop is enough to feed two as a second course, or a solo diner as a one plate meal, a recommended move as many of the appetizers are entirely forgettable. Deconstructed BLTs turn out to be jaw-aching slabs of bacon with bland pimento cheese and ho-hum fried green tomatoes. Even worse are fried chicken and waffle sandwiches, two leaden gut bombs stuffed with overly-fatty thigh meat. And corn on the cob is doused in a one-note cornbread butter and stale popcorn.

Waiters actually exit the restaurant and serve guests from the sidewalk, a clever people-flow strategy that keeps the slim dining room from getting too crowded.", "Meatloaf; Shrimp and grits", "The sides are stellar, waffle cut fries with dill pickle remoulade would be a best-seller at any Major League ballgame, and the caprese salad, with tart green tomatoes and grilled peaches, approaches near classic status thanks to a few drops of malty molasses vinegar subbing in for balsamic. Meatloaf isn't really meatloaf, but rather a shredded, $24 square of short rib disguised as brownie. The red wine tang and griddle-crisped beefiness result in a product that could easily compete with the (excellent) $42 version at Tom Colicchio's Craft. And as for the shrimp and grits \u2014 this is the version to compare all other versions to. The crustaceans pack that gentle maritime tang that let you know they come from good waters; the grits are bursting with robust corn flavor; and the country ham, shellfish jus, and Brooklyn lager sauce combine to produce such a funky, salted, umami-packed punch I was convinced the chefs slipped some fermented XO sauce in there (they did not).

There are now at least eight Sichuan restaurants in the neighborhood by my count, plus nearly a dozen stalls that offer it in Flushing\u2019s sprawling food courts. The oldest restaurant is Szechuan House, founded in 1985 (it has cycled through a few names under the same ownership over the years). Located on the same block of seedy looking commercial buildings where Little Pepper was to get its start in 2005, at the time it was surrounded by massage parlors and gambling dens.", "Now the block has become more upscale, featuring a glitzy new food court.

The name comes from the fact that, if you squint your eyes, the finely ground pork looks like insects clinging to the noodles.", "Tea-smoked duck is cooked until the dark carmine flesh achieves a pastrami-like texture, while \"spicy slice beef and tendon\" ($7.95), heavily glossed with chile oil, has a few frilly pieces of honeycomb tripe thrown in to vary the terrain. Few Sichuan restaurants in town do whole fish as well as Szechuan House.

According to an ancient tale, the low-lying land was once defended by a great dyke that kept the waters out. A pair of princes were in charge of the sluice gates, one of whom was a drunkard. When it was his turn to tend the gates one evening, the inebriated prince passed out at low tide leaving them open, and the ocean soon came rushing in, permanently drowning the land. It is said that in times of danger, the ringing of submerged church bells can still be heard. Archeologists who have examined the bottom of the shallow bay have found stones with Roman inscriptions, and artifacts from more recent habitations \u2014 meaning that the legend might be true.\r", "Sunken Hundred is also the moniker of a new Welsh restaurant on the border of Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill. The exterior is blue clapboard with white trim, suggesting a quayside pub, and just inside the front door tables are cozily wedged into a pair of windowed niches; they're the best seats in the house. Further inside, one wall holds a striking painting of Cantre'r Gwaelod (Welsh for \"Sunken Hundred\"), showing haunting shapes rising out of a foggy seascape. A line of tables lie along that wall; opposite, a bar dispenses themed cocktails and a limited selection of wines and beers \u2014 alas, no Welsh brews, which are difficult to import, as a waitress confided one evening.", "How does Welsh food differ from English? Well, the overlap is around 80 percent, but Welsh cuisine pays much more attention to seafood of a surprisingly diverse sort. Thanks to the fecund warmth of the Gulf Stream, Welsh waters teem with sea creatures and edible plants. One thing you'll find again and again on Sunken Hundred's menu is seaweed, especially the dried variety known as nori in Japanese and laver in English. Fried into squiggly fritters, it's the free bar snack served warm when you order a happy hour drink.", "That same laver also figures in two entrees on a menu that's mercifully concise. Seafood cawl ($19) might be called a Celtic bouillabaisse, a thickish broth bobbing with shrimp and squid and a pair of croutons smeared with orange rouille. Stuck to the inside of the bowl is a sheet of nori that may be pulled down with your spoon and sampled every time a little extra flavor is required. In another entr\u00e9e, a cliff of bone-white hake ($18) rises out of a sea of chunky tomato sauce flavored with butter and seaweed, giving the fish more flavor than it rightfully possesses. But the best main course is ffagodau ($14), a landlubber's delight of lamb and pork meatballs shot with organ meats that give them a liver-y savor, awash in multiple sauces including smooshed minty peas and onion gravy.", "Sunken Hundred's pasty is the city's most spectacular, the surface dusted with sea salt and a tomato chutney pooled on the side.", "In line with modern culinary practice, a large majority of the offerings fall into small-dish categories: Bites, Sides, and Shares. Among the Bites find a lamb pasty (pronounced \"pass-tee\") \u2014 a pastry that originated in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where it is known as an empanada. From there it was carried by Celts to Cornwall and Wales in what is now the United Kingdom, a vivid reminder of an ancient peripatetic race whose food culture persists. Sunken Hundred's pasty is the city's most spectacular, the surface dusted with sea salt and a tomato chutney pooled on the side.", "While it's tempting to call that pasty the best thing on the menu, there have been several other candidates. Poached razor clams ($14), now out of season, featured the elongated shellfish poached, cut in sections, and flavored with charred lemon and lamb jus \u2014 proving that, for Welsh cooks, the idea of lamb is never far from their minds. Known as chips, the French fries at Sunken Hundred are also excellent. Even though they appear in the Sides section, one may readily treat them as an app, and a cost-wise one at that ($7). Did I mention that the homemade ketchup is seaweed flavored?", "[Top: lamb pasties, and seafood cawl. Bottom: pork and lamb meatballs.", "The dessert list is very short, maybe because the savory fare is so rich, and drink flows freely among the patrons. (Sunken Hundred is foremost a pub, after all.) Yet the desserts tell you as much about Welsh cuisine as any other section of the menu. There's bara brith ($9), a slice of tea cake heavy with candied fruit, fried on a griddle and presented with a scoop of walnut-rum ice cream. Equally good are the Welsh cake sandwiches \u2014 saucer-shaped cakes crusted with granulated sugar and accompanied by thick clotted cream and hedgerow jam, made with hard, late-season berries that are only fit for making preserves.", "And this is where Sunken Hundred leaves you, eating jam distilled from the hedgerows that run along country lanes in Wales.

The quenelle, at Le Coucou, is a maritime marshmallow in a crustacean latte.

It takes a few more cues from a heady continental past than it does from a pared-down stateside present. There is no veal candy, only veal tongue. There are no ultra dry-aged ribeyes, only bone marrow-sauced filet mignon with pommes boulangere.", "There are no rules against seating incomplete parties (praise the Lord). There is no dining at the bar, and to drive that point home, there are no stools at said bar. It's there for sipping non-alcoholic peach shrub cocktails and stretching your legs before a three-hour bacchanalia that can run $150 per person (those who order more prudently can slip out in under two hours).", "You'll tolerate that price, and the tasting menu duration of this a la carte meal because against most prevailing norms, the brick-walled, chateau-chic Le Coucou is cavernous and comfortable. That statement will be all the more true four years from now when chefs have us all eating with our hands behind our backs in pre-paid increments of thirty minutes at ticketed communal feeding troughs with kale quinoa IV drips.", "So if it's a surprise that Rose is raking in the crowds with \u2014 and I mean this as a compliment \u2014\u0080\u0094 an epic pile of pike panade, the bigger shock is that Le Coucou actually exists. Sure, La Grenouille is still alive and thriving, slinging its own majestic quenelles de brochet in Champagne cream, but most of the old-school school fancy French stalwarts (La Caravelle, Lutece, and La Cote Basque)\u0080\u0094 closed in the early aughts, as did their ideological successors, from Gordon Ramsay to Adour Alain Ducasse to Villard Michel Richard.", "  ", "Quenelle de brochet (top); \"Tout la lapin\"; A salad of tomatoes and strawberries", "Indeed, the Gallic scene in New York is stronger than it's ever been.

But since the Great Recession wreaked havoc on the American economy, prompting a younger generation of chefs to pursue a leaner, cheaper approach to gourmet food, the cronuts seem stacked against culinarians iterating on The Grand Fancy French spot.", "Le Coucou isn't concerned with those odds. It's thriving right now not in Midtown but downtown, with a 39-year-old chef showing up to the cool kids' corner and iterating on his grandfather's prom suit. There's your disruption right there.", "One minute Rose goes all 1960s light, bright nouvelle cuisine. He finds two of nature's most fragrant fruits, one sweet (strawberries), one savory (tomatoes) and doubles down on the perfume by matching them with a gazpacho of the same ingredients. The next minute he's all cuisine classique, scooping up sweetbreads the texture of pudding and serving them tableside in such a generous wash of tarragon cream sauce that it would constitute a serving of chowder in lesser restaurants.", "Then comes a hat tip to slightly more recent times. Rose grills lobster tail to the firmness of prime rib, scents the shellfish with its own oil, and matches it with cool Bibb lettuce, basil, candied lemon, and a hot grilled tomato. The presentation is very 1980s steakhouse, stark and with the sauce on the side. And in this case it's a traditional sauce Lauris, a mix of paprika and mayonnaise made famous by the extant Guy Savoy.", "The fact that Rose makes all these incongruities work in a single meal highlights his peripatetic, kaleidoscopic view of the past, and it's all nearly flawless. Nearly. So let's talk about a certain a pre-El Bulli spherification: oeuf norv\u00e9gien, a soft-boiled egg wrapped in chive cream and artichoke and covered by a sphere of smoked salmon. Call it brunch in a ball, a pescatarian scotch egg designed to make a 1970s Better Homes &amp; Gardens editor swoon.

The chef has spoken of making Le Coucou a Lutece of its own era, a callback to Andre Soltner's venue that was equal parts haute cuisine and high society hangout, but Major Food Group's Goodfellas-esque Carbone, a Michelin-starred update to the Italian-American chophouse, really is the better point of reference. That's not because Le Coucou traffics in pastiche, but because it takes advantage of its black hole gravity \u2014\u0080\u0094 and Starr's renowned devotion to Hollywood set design \u2014\u0080\u0094 to wow New Yorkers with a few of the overlooked (or undervalued) culinary wonders of yesteryear. It's not a bad thing in an era where where newer restaurants are feeling increasingly uniform in their offerings.", "It's a bromide to say what's old is new again, so let me put the wonders of Le Coucou in the following empirical context: It really is a commentary on the staid state of cooking in New York that one of the most refreshing piscine preparations I've had in quite some time is Rose's halibut in (the once ubiquitous) beurre blanc, the lean flaky fish elevated to heart-clogging bliss with enough emulsified butter and wine to cover the entire plate. Underneath the filet lies a mound of daikon sauerkraut: a tart, translucent not-quite-kimchi to wink at modernity before a diner drags it through all the fat.", "The caviar course is a staple of any grand French restaurant. This indulgence typically involves about 30 grams of fish roe over ice and starts at well over a hundred bucks. At Le Coucou, the barrier to entry is lowered in exchange for a smaller portion. Cost: $38 for a coral-colored pile of golden osetra atop veal tongue. The soft meat gently warms the firm roe, helping release its briny overtones, while the caviar in turn salts the delicately flavored tongue. It evokes an era when caviar was plentiful enough to season a dish, rather than being marketed as the star of a composition.", "Le Coucou is obvious in its luxuries: Lobster appears in three appetizers, foie gras in two, Wagyu in one. But their use isn't always obvious. The Wagyu is not steak, but rather tripe; it's been soaked, braised, fried, and laid over a brunoise of pickles and olives. Think of the crispy organ \u2014\u0080\u0094 a style of stomach not uncommon in Lyon \u2014 as a fun French analogue to a Japanese pork tonkotsu.", "The wanton maxim \"to share,\" commonly deployed by restaurants to justify the $150 chicken, isn't found on the Coucou menu, but perhaps it should be, as all of the fairly-priced mains are arguably portioned for two. Heck \"tout le lapin\" (all of the rabbit) could feed three. It's a wild trio of gamy loin (drizzled with kidney vinaigrette), neutral hind legs cooked with mustard and onions, and restorative pot-au-feu for the nutty front legs.", "Bourride", "Bourride, the classic cloudy seafood stew of Provence (a Pernod-free cousin to bouillabaisse) is skimmed and strained into a clear-as-vodka consomm\u00e9. It tastes of concentrated ocean and salt and sun-baked algae. You use a ladle to retrieve more broth from a Mauviel copper pot, which you pour over a delicate slice of black bass. You spoon a swath of aioli into the soup, dampening the littoral funk, but stinging the palate with garlic.", "No ile flottantes or oeufs \u00e0 la neige grace the dessert menu, and rightly so, as such ethereal creations would be redundant with the savory quenelles. But throwbacks abound here, from a rice pudding like any other, to a rarely seen chiboust \u2014\u0080\u0094 stiff pastry cream atop cherries \u2014\u0080\u0094 to a vertical take on mousse, with infinite shavings of dark chocolate rising above the fluff like an accidental mille feuille of black truffles.", "Le Coucou doesn't blow you away in in the same way that experimental Brooklyn spots like Olmsted do, nor does it intend to. It's an assured, steady-handed restaurant at just three months old. It makes you look forward to more from Rose, who's entered the New York fray with a smart Starr blockbuster instead of an edgy independent flick. And it's the type of venue that will surely attract more to oldies like La Grenouille or more modern spots like Le Bernardin. Say what you will about 11 Howard (a $500/night Aby Rosen hotel that replaces a Holiday Inn) and what it symbolizes for the future of the city\u0080, but Le Coucou is the beating, albeit transplanted, heart of grand old French cuisine in New York right now.", "Ryan Sutton is Eater's chief restaurant critic.

The weather was sweltering, the perfect time to test the creamy chickpea dip redolent of wind-whipped sands and the merciless desert sun. My first stop was Ta\u00efm, a small storefront just off Perry Street specializing in flavored falafels run by Israeli chef Einat Admony. Pooled with olive oil and rimmed with sumac, the hummus was liquid and salty and nutlike. It was tendered with a pita brushed with olive oil and za\u2019atar  that served as the perfect flavor foil. At historic Mamoun\u2019s on MacDougal Street \u2014 where hummus was popularized in the \u201870s, becoming an instant hit with students, vegetarians, and bohos \u2014 the product was pastier and more richly flavored, tasting pungently of cumin, lemon, and garlic, though the cardboard pitas were a disappointment.", "A short ride against traffic brought me to Hummus Place on 7th Avenue South just off Bleecker Street. Founded a decade ago in the East Village, it was one of the first places in town to suggest that hummus could be the centerpiece of an entire menu \u2014 an idea that Dizengoff was later to adopt. At Hummus Place the product flaunted its slippery texture and strong olive oil taste, but offered little else in the way of flavor thrills. Which brings us to the whole point of this round-up. Several times sitting at Dizengoff\u2019s curving red counter I\u2019ve heard customers exclaim, \"This is the best hummus I\u2019ve ever tasted!\" And I wondered, \"Could it really be the best?\"", "Located in one of the food court areas of the Chelsea Market, Dizengoff is a Philadelphia import, part of chef Michael Solomonov and business partner Steve Cook\u2019s expanding restaurant empire there, which includes a\u00a0sit-down Israeli restaurant, a\u00a0Jewish Eastern European tapas joint, a\u00a0doughnut and fried chicken carryout, a first Dizengoff, and, until a recent sale, an\u00a0American-style barbecue. New York\u2019s Dizengoff seats around 20 at a counter that undulates alongside a kitchen with a flaming metal oven. Above the counter are ranked cans of Israeli pickles. But the oven is the center of attention, and from it fly thick and lightly charred pitas that vie with the hummus as the most important part of the meal. They arrive steaming, packaged in formfitting paper bags.", "Yes, it\u2019s the best hummus in town. ", "But how is the hummus? Elemental might be the best description. The flavor is limited to a single strong and lingering note: cumin. The texture is fluffy; almost unbelievably so. In fact, as you sit mopping it from the inside of your black plastic container with a torn fragment of pita, it threatens to detach itself and ascend to the ceiling. Yes, it\u2019s the best hummus in town. In addition to the flatbread that comes alongside, you also get a chopped Israeli salad, a slender cucumber pickle or two, and some house-pickled onion swatches that, as the counter guy hastened to tell me one afternoon, \"should be used as alternate scoops for the hummus.\"", "[Clockwise, from the top left: the dining counter, hummus with vegetables, chef/partner Emily Seaman, hummus with chicken]", "By itself, hummus would forever remain a condiment or a side dish. So what goes in the middle for your further dipping pleasure is of supreme importance. This is the responsibility of chef/partner Emily Seaman, who, in the early days of the Chelsea Market Dizengoff, was seen heroically pulling pitas from the oven. (When she\u2019s not making them, they are sometimes not as good.) Five hummus variations priced from $10 to $13 are available, but part of the genius of the place is that the roster is always shifting, making a visit to Dizengoff a culinary adventure. Many, like tahini, fava beans, or a soft-boiled egg (which sometimes comes with potato chips) are entirely predictable.", "Others that aren\u2019t have included zucchini with hazelnuts, sliced avocado with peanut harissa, and romanesco \u2014 that green fractal vegetable in the cauliflower family \u2014 with toasted pine nuts. If you\u2019ve gotten the idea that Dizengoff is a vegetarian joint with lots of vegan options, you\u2019re right. But additionally offered is one meaty topping per day, at the highest price tier. In the early days it was lamb. Which was also a bit of a disappointment because it was lamb stew rather than a charcoal-grilled kebab, which is the more conventional accompaniment. Currently, the choice is coarsely ground chicken in red oil with Persian spices, which is beyond delicious. In fact, it\u2019s my favorite topping of all those I\u2019ve tried over the last four months.", "[shakshuka]", "That\u2019s pretty much the extent of Dizengoff\u2019s menu. From 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. you can also enjoy shakshuka ($10), eggs poached in a tomato-chile sauce, served with the aforementioned pita. There\u2019s also a rotating selection of composed cold dishes, called salatim ($4 each, 3 for $11 with pita). These run from the exciting (matbucha, a braised tomato salad) to the not-so-exciting (stewed cabbage, wherein the vegetable was undercooked, making it a slog to eat).

The concept was simple and brilliant, and the premises were perfect in an icy and backward-looking sort of way. \"This is Bedford Avenue?\" The masses gasped, as lines wove out the door and down the street.

Leather banquettes and bent-cane chairs provide seating, and illumination is furnished by chandeliers with tulip-shaped Art Nouveau shades. \"This seems much more like fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna than Paris,\" a photographer friend exclaimed one evening as she ran her eye around the room, and then contemplated with pleasure the vegetable-intensive menu.", "That bill of fare is divided into five sections by size and dish composition. In a tip of the hat to the more comprehensive raw bar at Maison Premiere, the menu begins with a mini-section that includes a single oyster service, queen crab in brown butter, and a pair of bright red Carabinero prawns tendered on ice with thick saffron aioli ($14). Those who hate to peel and eat will skip the prawns, but they\u2019ll be missing some very striking crustaceans. The regular appetizer list shows some of the creative verve that characterizes the chef\u2019s best work, including a finely diced fluke crudo in a whitish fluid that turns out to be whey.", "My favorite app \u2013 apart from a delightful corn-and-chanterelle soup that\u2019s just the thing to cool your throat on a sweltering evening \u2014 is the leek terrine ($13), rubbery planks of precisely the same dimension bound together with gelatin like sticks of gum in a pack. The terrine arrives deposited on juice-soaked whole-grain bread. To help you identify just what kind of juice, tiny manila clams are also seen rolling around the plate. The dish seems pure whimsy on the part of the chef, putting a smile on the face of every diner who orders it.", "Indeed, the chef everywhere shows her enthusiasm for garlic.", "Despite the plethora of vegetarian apps, there\u2019s also a bonus section called Vegetables that is even larger and more meatless. Highlights include a shallow bowl of stuffed and poached vegetables called petit farce (there\u2019s that sense of whimsy again), and a crunchy dish of sunchokes, croutons, and garlic scapes that produces one of the most powerful garlic punches of the season. Indeed, the chef everywhere shows her enthusiasm for garlic. Sadly, a couple of vegetarian offerings don\u2019t quite work, including a carrot carpaccio featuring the thin-sliced commodity prettily plated, but a real chore to chew.", "[Top: the pig head for two. \u00a0Bottom: pork chop and prawns]", "Especially if you\u2019re a vegetarian or like to eat more lightly, you could do very well sticking to the small dishes.

Six outdoor benches are arranged in a large U shape around the perimeter, the type of seating plan that tasting menu spots construct around an open kitchen. (\"The cooks are the entertainment!\") Here, the benches are situated in a tiny urban farm. Patrons sit on fabric cushions, sipping orange wine and noshing on fried pickled fiddlehead ferns or puffy crawfish chips, watching fireflies glow a bioluminescent yellow. At Olmsted, the garden is theater. The raised beds around the benches are covered with a carpet of greenery so thick and soft it's a wonder folks don't try to slip the staff a $50, take off their shoes, and lie down amid the vegetation, a pastoral analogue to tipsilly wading through pool at The Four Seasons.", "There are no tables out here; the garden is for snacks, cocktails, dessert, and sweating. It is 80 degrees on a summer night. A soft breeze blows through, and Japanese hand fans are scattered about for additional relief. A quail walks to and fro in a coop at the back of the yard. They're kept for their eggs. \"We don't slaughter them,\" a waiter reassures me, unprompted. I want to respond that I'd be okay with it if they did.", "NY Grass-Fed Bavette (top); Watermelon Sushi", "In heat like this, it's tempting to invert the usual order of things and kick off an evening's festivities with something cool, something sweet, so I order dessert. A server ferries over a small ceramic bowl filled with white fluff adorned with flowers. Half of each spoonful is delicate, ethereal, honeyed, aromatized with lavender. This is whipped cream. The other half is cold, dense, and sour. This is frozen yogurt. The dish, as well-balanced as any of the more savory starters, is a monochromatic study in temperature and texture: It's nearly impossible to tell which of the two ingredients you're eating until it's actually in your mouth. It recalls Heston Blumenthal's iconic Hot Tea Cold Tea, a preparation where the two distinct beverage sit in a single glass with no barrier. Rarely in cuisine have cognitive dissonance and color been used in concert to such brilliant effect.", "The garden, the wine, the great-tasting intellectualism \u2014\u00a0it's the type of outdoor epicurean bliss you might expect to encounter at one of the country's most expensive culinary establishments. And yet at Olmsted, a modest storefront restaurant in Brooklyn's well-heeled Prospect Heights, most dishes are under $20. Credit due to Greg Baxtrom, a chef who's spent time working at venues where $800 meals for two are not uncommon \u2014 Stone Barns, Atera, Alinea, Per Se \u2014 for giving New York one of its most paradoxically ambitious yet most approachable restaurants. After just three months in business, Olmsted easily joins the ranks of Estela and Wildair as one of the city's best and most creative small-plates places.", "Olmsted's watermelon sushi, for example, is the type of nigiri Masa Takayama wished he were serving at his $598-a-head temple to raw fish. Baxtrom takes thin slices of Long Island fluke and paper-thin rounds of confit lemon, wraps both around pinky-sized sticks of the crimson melon, and finishes it all with fleur de sel. The sugars from the fruit, when mixed with the tart citrus and the high-end salt, electrify in the mouth; it's like a high end Sour Patch Kid.", "One of the secrets to that watermelon sushi is a thin layer of herb oil, infused with clippings from the restaurant's garden. Ian Rothman, Baxtrom's partner in the 50-seat endeavor, oversees the backyard farm, and if the food here wasn't so good you'd roll your eyes at his bio. Rothman was the horticulturist at Atera, where (as Olmsted's website explains), he \"oversaw the restaurant's subterranean garden and living wall.\" All those who reckoned that a more pared-down spot like Olmsted might be deprived of its own living wall (let's stop using that phrase): Fret not. Rothman has constructed a mosaic of green stuff that spans the length of the interior portion of the restaurant.", "The garden is in use during service, too: I watch a chef go out back to snip off some greens, perhaps a bit of lovage for the chawanmushi. The kitchen fries it up with spring garlic shoots and arranges the mixture atop of the delicate dish. With just a tap of your spoon they crackle and crunch like autumn leaves. Now take a bite: Summer truffles impart a whisper of woodsy funk, the garlic shocks the tongue with bitterness, and the soft, savory custard resets your palate with just a touch of sweetness. It's a $16 appetizer, but it wouldn't be out of place in a multi-hundred-dollar kaiseki menu.", "It's almost too good to be true. Isn't it?", "Olmsted's backyard garden", "\"An affordable neighborhood restaurant is what we want,\" Baxtrom wrote to me via email. And while Olmsted's pricing scheme accords with that statement, the caliber of food he's serving makes things just a bit more complicated. Your typical neighborhood spot doesn't command two hour waits on a Friday. The more accurate way to consider Olmsted might be as a destination local restaurant. It's a venue that fills a need in the immediate community \u2014 Prospect Heights has plenty of casual weeknight spots, but no real history of haute cuisine \u2014 and yet it also ends up attracting a city-wide crowd \u2014 likely to be national, once word gets out.", "A destination local restaurant presents a dilemma, as adulation and accolades (not to mention suddenly impossible-to-get-tables) tend to change a place. A prime example was the December 2007 issue of Bon Appetit: the powers that were decided to give the cover to the meatball sliders served at the Little Owl, an affordable West Village haunt that was already pretty packed every night. It was a seminal moment for small restaurants, many of whom had been living in the shadow of the Buddakan-style big box behemoths that arose in the late aughts, and a presager of the post-recession return to more intimate dining.", "Carrot Crepe (top); chef Greg Baxtrom at the pass; Olmsted's interior", "In the end, the hordes came and went, and the Little Owl remained true to itself; it's more or less the same charming restaurant now as it was before its spotlight moment in 2006. But not all restaurants weather the attention so unchanged. When another destination neighborhood spot, NoLiTa's walk-in only Torrisi Italian Specialities, started to attract fans thanks to its affordable set menu, it slowly raised its price from $45 to $100, and then beyond. What began as a welcome antidote to fine dining became yet another expensive \u2014 albeit excellent \u2014 practitioner of the art.", "None of this is to deny a good restaurant the chance to capitalize on its fame and evolve over the course of its lifespan. But in an era with so many operators pushing the tasting menu hard, it's heartwarming to see Olmsted take a more populist approach to ambitious gastronomy (Baxtrom tells me he has no plans to ever go prix-fixe only). It's also exciting to have another outer-borough pole holding up the city's high-end dining scene, which has spent the last decade spreading slowly (arguably too slowly) outward from Manhattan.", "To put Olmsted's prices in perspective: A bottle of well-balanced orange wine runs $30 (a Manhattan venue could easily charge twice that). And the steak entree is $23 \u2014 a dollar more than a pizza at Franny's a few blocks away. That steak, by the way, is flawless: It's a grass-fed bavette that's silky as Japanese Wagyu; it delivers not a dry-age funk but an obscene beefiness. Baxtrom changes up the accompaniments depending on the season; when I dined there, he amped up the bovine factor with a tiny squash filled with a ratatouille that was a bit muskier than usual, thanks to a layer of beef short rib.", "Fans of the atavistic appetizer-entree-dessert format might argue that Olmsted's servings are a touch small even by small plate standards. I'll counter that I've never tried anything here that isn't large enough to share. For a proper meal for two, you'll want to order about seven dishes \u2014\u00a0six shared savory plates, one dessert \u2014 plus a bottle of wine.", "One thing that should not be shared, however, is the carrot crepe. This is a preparation so fantastic it deserves to be enjoyed in full, on first and subsequent visits, without fear of having a companion steal a precious morsel.", "Olmsted's carrot crepe is not what it seems. It looks like a typically fussy salad, atop an orange disc dotted with flower petals. Then you rip through this decorative facade with your fork. Beneath lie soft little neck clams (or sometimes surf clams) and a rich yellow carrot jus infused with the flavor of the sea. Your palate is overwhelmed with butter and brine. Baxtrom has reimagined linguine with clams through the lens of a root vegetable, a French crepe, and the colors of a sunflower. It's stunning.", "But as cutting edge as Olmsted is, it wouldn't be a proper 2016 restaurant if it didn't offer an agrodolce cauliflower, the current reigning version of which is gobi manchurian, a sino-subcontinental snack that involves turning the plant into a vegan riff on General Tso's chicken. Baxtrom goes more refined with an analogue called gobi pakoda; the fried romesco choufleur isn't drenched in neon goo, but rather sits adjacent a curried gastrique that's nearly as dark as a demi-glace. A candy-like sweetness hits you first, then a tamarind tang, then a wallop of heat from jalape\u00f1o.", "Scallops, the throwaway entree of the past 15 years (\"Maybe we should sear them?\") find a new relevance by being threaded on skewers and grilled over charcoal, with a wicked coating of deeply flavored pasilla chiles. Some of the mollusks are firm and cooked through, others are charred on the outside and enjoyably jiggly within; just when things threaten to get too salty, a mess of creamed corn, cooked in the style of risotto, resets the palate, its sweetness an early foreshadowing of dessert.", "Follow those up with the sublime steak or a roulade of guinea hen, at $24 the most expensive large plate, though good enough that I'd happily pay double that. The bird's gamy white meat is rolled around ramp mousse and roasted, sometimes creating the visual effect of a yin and yang when sliced. The sweeter, funkier thigh meat is doused under a swathe of foamy ramp hollandaise; searching for the morsels with a fork evokes a Michelin-starred riff on bobbing for apples. (Baxtrom says all the manipulation allows him to squeak out three instead out two portions out of each hen, helping him keep the price low.) Finish it up, then give up your table (if you like; there's no pressure from the elegant service team) to walk back outside for dessert.

The place seats about 80 in a deep, sparsely decorated room. Golconda Chimney offers a more sophisticated take on the cuisines of Hyderabad and South India than the other restaurants in Jersey City. In fact, it deserves to be counted among places like Indian Accent, Babu Ji, and Tapestry that are lately heralding an Indian dining renaissance in New York City. In contrast to those other places, though, the food tends to be more assertive and more highly spiced, perhaps because most of the patrons are South Asian, while Manhattan restaurants often tone down their spice palettes for a mixed audience.", "If you're a goat lover, Golconda Chimney is for you. On its sprawling 18-page menu, 17 selections incorporating the horned and sure-footed beast are listed. There's a goat biryani ($13.99), of course, featuring succulent boneless pieces among the spice-scented grains, with a boiled egg perched like a bulbous white bird on top. It comes sided with thick yogurt raita. Also worth trying is goat sukha, a bony mass in an oily chile bath that makes it seem almost Sichuan. Gnaw away!", "Goat paya soup and chicken lollipops.", "Gongura goat is cooked to tenderness with its namesake leaves, imparting a tart flavor, while goat pepper fry describes generous hunks of meat with a cumin rub simply roasted, concentrating the flavor. My favorite, though, is goat paya soup ($6.59), made with leathery and gummy shank in a silky broth glinting with collagen droplets. \"This will be very good for my skin!\" one of my vainer guests proclaimed enthusiastically.", "Chicken is another Hyderabad favorite, as evidenced by such South Indian regional classics as chicken chettinad ($11.99), featuring tomatoes, coconut, and poppy seeds. Native to the city, dum ka murg ($14.99) immerses bone-in chicken morsels in a mellow sauce thickened with cashews and chironji (seeds of the Buchanania lanzan tree, which taste like almonds). Such ingredients, exotic to most New Yorkers, abound at Golconda Chimney, where every meal is an adventure in culinary geography. But one of the best chicken dishes comes from the Indo-Chinese canon: Chicken lollipop ($9.99) features the drumstick with the flesh pushed to the top, tinted bright red and fried, with just a hint of heat \u2014 like Buffalo wings with an Indian twist.", "Goat pepper fry with machli ka salan and vegetable kohlapuri.", "There are plenty of other desirable apps, including crunchy chaats, and pakoda shaped like flat brown falafels filled with spinach. Vegetarians will find plenty to admire among the entrees, too. Vegetarian kohlhapuri is a brightly colored vegetable m\u00e9lange sprinkled with grated coconut. Pescatarians will be delighted by machli ka salan \u2014 white filet swimming in a dark pool of astringent fenugreek leaves. The menu offers fairly lengthy descriptions of each dish, so if you don't have a South Indian food expert with you, you're not entirely on your own. And don't hesitate to Google freely before you order.", "What all this culinary abundance means as a practical matter is that there's no substitute for taking a big gang along on your first trip to the restaurant and trying lots of things\u2014 because there's no better introduction to South Indian regional cuisines, in the five boroughs or Jersey City than Golconda Chimney.", "Robert Sietsema is Eater NY's senior critic.

The main thoroughfare, which resembles that of a small town on Long Island, centers on a roughly eight-block stretch of Northern Boulevard that winds its tree-lined way past neat stand-alone shops dating from the 1950s, newer strip malls, many restaurants, Protestant churches, a library, a war memorial framed by blooming rose bushes, and a picture-perfect town square.

The dish delivers a good Sichuan peppercorn wallop, in contrast to most Sichuan restaurants in town, which play it rather mild. But if you really crave incendiary, head for Yibin burning noodles ($8.95), named for a small city in southeastern Sichuan. Found on the restaurant's separate brunch menu, this spaghetti cook-up comes gobbed with sweet soy sauce, red-chile flakes, and the aforementioned peppercorns, which will leave you gasping as you reach for your water glass. The meaty topping is mainly not meat. In addition to a little ground pork it also contains sichuan peppercorns, ground chile, soy sauce, scallions, sesame seeds, and peanuts.", "One of the best things we tried was somewhat confusingly called \"Chengdu green bean noodles\" ($6.95). It turned out not to contain any green beans, but instead, squarish translucent planks of the mung bean starch known as liang fen, laved with a thick, cold chile vinegar \u2014 as bracing as an early morning by the seaside. Speaking of vegetarian, Grain House offers some fine fried leek dumplings, flattened like pancakes, and a whole catalog of surprising vegetables. You don't have to be a hippie taking a bath to enjoy pale green loofah (an immature form of the back-scrubbing sponge); or an immigrant from Henan to appreciate finely textured scrambled eggs and tomatoes, a recipe that originated in that region.", "  ", "Nor is the food of far western Xinjiang neglected, a particular passion of Beijing residents, who buy cumin-dusted lamb, chicken, and pork kebabs from distinctive food carts. (Similar carts can now be found in Flushing, about six miles due west of Little Neck on Northern Boulevard.) Lamb with cumin ($18.95) is a heaping platter of shredded meat flavored with cilantro stems, roasted red chiles, and Asian-varietal cumin, the seeds of which are smaller and more pungent than the Western kinds. Still, you'll feel like you're eating Middle Eastern food when you take a first bite.", "Among the northern Chinese flourishes Grain House offers are a couple of dishes made with puffed rice, which is the smoky tasting grain that adheres to the bottom of the pan. One example is \"crust of cooked rice with chicken\" ($13.95). Studded with wood-ear mushrooms and bamboo, the dish features sliced chicken punctuated with planks of puffed rice that become increasingly soggy as the level in the serving bowl diminishes.

There\u2019s one type of Chinese cooking that's often hotter. Just to the southeast of Sichuan in the province of Hunan is a cuisine considered fierier, though it generally omits the electric excitement of ma la peppercorns. Instead, Hunan deploys a devastating combination of dried red chiles, fresh green chiles, black and white peppercorns, and \u2014 somewhat unique to its arsenal \u2014 pickled chiles, often used in soupy recipes like \"steamed fish head with chopped chiles.\"", "Ferried to the table in a broad, bone-white bowl, the appearance couldn\u2019t be more striking.

A good quantity of saffron-colored fluid sloshes around its perimeter, in which bits of pickled chile dance.

The copious sauce constitutes the heart of the meal, containing all the steeped goodness of the skin and bones, making what the French would call a fumet. This magnificent broth can serve to moisten gallons of fleecy white rice, as the assembled diners take turns picking bits of flesh off the head, milky eyeballs first. The $26.95 price tag partly reflects the cultural value of this dish, since an entire fish with lots more flesh with an equal quantity of sauce paradoxically costs $2 less.", "Steamed fish head", "Open nearly three months on the same block as the mediocre-but-wildy-popular Philly import Han Dynasty, Hunan Bistro languishes half-full on most evenings. The interior is a comfortable mish-mash, with nautical lamps hanging from the ceiling, prim beige banquettes lining the walls, a private room visible through vertical slats, and a few cartoon figures pasted haphazardly on the dark wood paneling, in a half-hearted attempt to jolly the place up. Which should be totally unnecessary given the excellence of its offerings and uniqueness of Hunan food in the East Village.", "What is Hunan, anyway? Aside from the mixture of chiles, the cuisine boasts lots of preserved meats and vegetables, a broad array of cooking techniques not involving woks, and a strange propensity for mashing seemingly incongruous things. Thus green pepper with preserved egg ($14.95) arrives in a bowl already half-squished, but with a wooden pestle picturesquely sticking out as an invitation to further maceration. In the bowl are fresh green chiles, eggplant, and a couple of 100-year-old eggs, in which the whites have been transformed into translucent obsidian. The taste is fascinating, but one time the mash-up was hot as hell, another it was bland baby food.", "For an example of virtuoso pickling, look no further than the first appetizer, \"Hunan pickled cabbage\" ($5.95): pale leaves, whole red chiles, and fronds of cilantro, providing prodigious crunch and a subtle sourness. (The same vegetable appears to great effect in the highly recommended beef with pickled cabbage.) Meats and vegetables preserved by salting and drying also play an important role in the cuisine.

In 2016, the determination of value when it comes to a restaurant dish is indeed a complicated affair. But can a person really put a price on a miracle elixir?", "In his ossiferous opus Brodo: A Bone Broth Cookbook, Canora writes about broth the way some epidemiologists write about the polio vaccine. He reverently describes how his savory potions of bones and spices brings joint relief to arthritis sufferers. He explains that the hot, marrow-laced liquid helped him become a calmer, more peaceful man, thanks in part to the \"gut-brain connection.\" Take or leave these psychological, biological, and religious claims, but lord in heaven, that brodo is Hearth's best dish, and I'll pay whatever Canora asks for it.", "It starts with turkey, chicken, and beef bones, which have the shinola boiled out of them until they've fully disintegrated. Canora then adds turmeric, black pepper, and marrow, and ladles your serving into a aqua ceramic bowl, which you're instructed to pick up with your hands and drink from directly. The bronze-brown liquid smells of dry-aged beef. The collagen makes your lips stick together. The peppers warm your throat. It doesn't exactly whet the palate; rather, it snaps the senses back into focus after the dulling effect of the short walk in 10-degree windchill that brought you to the restaurant's door. This is, ideally, how you begin every meal at this brick-lined, dimly-lit neighborhood gem. It is transportive.", "But not too transportive. Coming back to life, aided by this rich broth, you see Momofuku overlord David Chang sitting in a corner booth; he's eating butter-drenched gnocchi perfumed with sage leaves. You hear the late, great Ol' Dirty Bastard crooning on the sound system: \"Ooh baby, I like it raw.\" And you realize you're here, in the East Village. You are at Hearth, a restaurant that is as awesome as it's ever been, even though it is, as of two months ago, an entirely different restaurant.", "Cured pork belly with marinated fennel (left); Hearth's updated interior", "Hearth opened in 2003 as a partnership between Marco Canora, the opening chef de cuisine at Craft, and Paul Greico, the goateed former wine director of Gramercy Tavern. (Greico left in 2014.) The cuisine was seasonal, Tuscan-inspired American fare, with intricate charcuterie boards, hearty ribollitas, earthy mushrooms, filling bollito mistos, and lush ribeyes for two.", "Things were great. Until they weren't. Over the years, Canora saw his rent rise by 65 percent. He was overweight. He was diagnosed with gout. And as guests who've sat at his chef's counter can attest, when things didn't go right in the kitchen, he occasionally did his best impression of Gordon Ramsay, shouting and cursing at underperforming cooks.", "But according to Canora (who has recognized me on every single visit I've made to his restaurant), he managed to turn his health around, curb his temper, and keep his business afloat, thanks to \u2014\u00a0well, thanks to soup. He started hawking the stuff (he calls it \"brodo,\" a nod to Hearth's Italian influences, though it's more commonly identifiable as bone broth) out of one of the restaurant's window in 2014. The Today Show aired a segment. Epicurious called it the new coffee. The New York Times compared it to the other haute addictions du jour, coconut water and green juice. People came in droves.", "Then in early 2016, Canora closed Hearth for a week, nixed traditional appetizers and entrees on the menu in favor of au-courant share plates, expanded the offerings to better reflect the healthful, nutrient-dense ethos of his beloved brodo and, in the end, debuted a slightly more comfortable room to match the resulting slightly higher cost of dining.", "This isn't a \"they replaced Shea Stadium with Citi Field\" renovation. Changes are subtle. Only regular guests of the old Hearth will notice the changes. The bar up front, formerly slate, is now jade marble, and the chef's counter is now butcher's block (I'd happily sleep on both). There's a long, soft leather banquette along the north wall, and the old rust-red ceiling is now painted an airy white. The pendant lamps might be new, but the lighting is still gentle enough to flatter your paper-thin radishes served over buttermilk, the gentle fats of the dairy softening the spice of the kaleidoscopic roots.", "Canora has long championed a narrative of enlightened gastronomy. Bar coasters at the original Hearth were emblazoned with Depression-era government mantras: \"Save what will keep, eat what will spoil.\" At Hearth reborn, Canora doubles down on that ethos. The back of the menu is printed with a 13-section mission statement that touts a ban on \"lions of the sea\" (swordfish, for example, is off the bill of fare); pledges support for the local greenmarket over the allure of \"certified organic\"; champions fresh fats (\"we change our fryer oil every day\"); and encourages everyone to eat offal, by way of a cute little story about a cheetah slaughtering a gazelle for its bloody organs.", "\"In the simplest terms, we only use meat from happy, healthy animals,\" reads the menu, a statement that would come across as a bromide if not for a more compelling truth that Canora doesn't publicize: The chef doesn't like how many young calves are weaned on powdered milk, and so Hearth has, for the time being, eliminated veal from what might be its most famous dish, the ethereal ricotta meatballs, which are now made with beef.", "Another rule: \"We mill our own flour and polenta from intact, non-GMO, heirloom varieties.\" Canora, true to form, puts his money where his mouth is. He cracks his own rye berries for for a red-cabbage-topped porridge (he calls it \"risotto\") that boasts the the texture of coarse polenta and that explodes with the flavor of caraway seeds. He grinds whole grain for toothsome homemade rigatoni, dressed with a pork ragu whose deep flavors linger like mole. And he breaks down buckwheat for pizzoccheri - short, earthy tagliatelle that stand up to stinky, stretchy fontina and heady mushrooms better than standard-issue semolina pasta ever could.", "Hearth still sells its famous gnocchi, which dissolve in the mouth with all the ease of pommes pur\u00e9e. Just one tweak: Canora switched to a local, small-production outlet for his all-purpose flour. And the butter coating those gnocchi, like all of the restaurant's cooking butter, comes from grass-fed cows, a pricey product that elsewhere might only be reserved for formal bread and butter. These under-the-hood changes contribute to the moral integrity of the revamped restaurant, and they also have a noticeable impact on a salient part of the Hearth experience: dining here now, you'll likely spend more than you would have last year.", "Spanish mackerel with cipollini onions, potatoes, and shellfish cream (left); the Variety Burger", "No, the old iteration of Hearth wasn't cheap, but the new version is downright expensive. Small plates add up, and it's likely that a proper dinner for two will exceed $100 per person after tax and tip. But it's worth it; the price is in line with the high quality of the food that Canora and his chef de cuisine, Luigi Petrocelli, are sending out. (The better deal, for those willing to give up a bit of control, is the six-course, $78 tasting, drawn from the a la carte menu.)", "Still, some of Hearth's portions are tiny even by small plates standards. A crispy-skinned cod square served with kale is, improbably, as indulgent as collards with ham hocks, but you're paying $26 for a fillet that's not much bigger than a deck of playing cards. Mackerel, illogically served in a bowl (please don't serve things that need to be cut in bowls), with an almost invisible layer of shellfish cream, delivers about three flawless bites of deliciously oily flesh for $21. Better bang for your small-plate buck comes in the form of pork belly, shaved like carpaccio under a rainforest canopy of fennel. It's a modestly sized plate, and with good reason: too much more of this salty, herbaceous bliss and the palate would go utterly dead.", "Among the heartier portions are the pastas and grains, including the very good bread service, which is no longer complimentary, nor should it be. Three large slices of Sullivan Street sourdough arrive with a trio of dips: grassy butter, fruity extra virgin olive oil, and smoky whipped lardo from, to borrow Canora's words, \"good clean pigs.\" A generous portion of carrot and beet tartare never seems to end, perhaps because the bland creation doesn't pack the same complexity as the foie gras or trout roe-laced versions at Little Park or Semilla. Instead, try the tart grilled cauliflower over a mash of smoked, shredded trout, a functional one-plate meal for $16.", "But the king of Hearth is cow. There are no traditional steaks on the menu, so you get your bovine fix from a few weighty slices of beef neck. The meat is braised, but the cow's grass-feeding (and barley finishing) means the lean cut has a heft that's closer to a firm filet mignon than it is to the short rib of a more conventional corn-fed steer. The flavor is concentrated, and doubly so when you drink the clear \"sauce,\" which isn't a reduced braising liquid but rather \u2014 there it is again \u2014\u00a0Canora's beef brodo.", "And then there's the burger. So often, the burger is the most middle-of-the-road item on a menu. Here, it's among the most challenging offerings. The \"Variety Burger\" is a medium-rare patty made from a coarse grind of brisket, chuck, heart, and liver. It's served with sweet potato wedge fries (heresy!) and without a bun (hiss!). The lack of bread means there's nothing but a slice of melted fontina and a heap of caramelized onions to soften the organ meats' clean, ferric blow. It is, without a doubt, the biggest risk a New York chef has taken with a hamburger since Daniel Boulud stuffed one with foie gras and truffles over a decade ago, and it's easily one of the standout dishes of the year.", "Desserts, from fried apple donuts to the dark chocolate board (which feels like a gourmet market raid), are great, but they don't wow the same way the brodo or burger does. And it's hard not to feel a swell of nostalgia for Grieco's wacky, annotated wine list and its epic Riesling selections. (There are still tons of Rieslings on offer, though only one by the glass.) Still. Canora deserves credit not just for turning his health around, but for keeping a neighborhood mainstay open and relevant in a city that eats up and spits out so many young venues a year in \u2014 let alone a dozen.

Via Brasil is the best of the eateries, decorated with an old-fashioned opulence that includes swirling stone tiles in the front barroom, a white piano for Brazilian jazz performances, a profusion of parrots, and leather banquettes that trail into the stained-wood interior, where Brazilian expat families survey the scene, whispering in Portuguese.", "Feijoada completa", "With entrees in the $18 to $29 range, the place looks as expensive as a typical bistro-level restaurant, but instead of small servings devoid of sides, that price gets you massive plates of food with all the trimmings, so that you can barely contemplate apps or desserts. The single serving of feijoada ($27) feeds two, while the portion for two ($34), would do fine for three. Dating from the days when there were no churrascarias in town, Via Brasil also provides a menu of grilled meats, of which the assortment called Rio Grande delivers chicken pieces, a thick pork chop, a sirloin steak, and a smoke-laced sausage.

Back home, the dish would probably be spicy as hell, but here flavorings are toned down somewhat, which does not prevent deliciousness.

The first thing you notice when you walk into Wassail is a row of taps protruding from a vertical gray surface behind the bar. No apparent labels, just stainless steel spigots with black bakelite pulls. As for the layout, there are three consecutive rooms, the first outfitted with a white-marble bar plus some window seating; the second a bit darker and quieter, the best tables along dimpled black banquettes; the last a bare-bones overflow room that should be avoided if possible.", "From those 16 black taps flow the beverages that are the heart of the place, draft apple ciders that, through their wonderfully woodsy flavors, conjure up the trees that produced the fruit with every sip. Some are lightly carbonated, some are still; some are sweet, some sour or even semi-skanky. These beverages come from several distinct areas of the world, most prominently Normandy, Asturias (not to be confused with Astoria), England, Virginia, Oregon, New England, and, in New York itself, the Hudson Valley, Finger Lakes, and Lake Ontario. Those who love to drink locally will find plenty to quaff at Wassail.", "In addition to those spigots, there\u2019s a list of around 120 bottled ciders in a chapbook, some from even more obscure parts of the globe (New Mexican cider? Chilean cider?), including one section that allows you to compare Basque ciders from both Spain and France. Then there are other apple-based beverages, including brandies, eau de vies, calvadoses, pommeaus, and ice ciders. The proper response to this plenitude, unless you already have a favorite apple-based beverage, is bewilderment. That line of taps will be your best refuge.", "From them, you may select an international flight of three ($15), and learn that the Spanish ciders, made from adventitious yeasts and bacteria, are delightfully sour and a bit skanky; French ciders pour clear, slightly sparkling, and on the sweet side; and the English product tastes a lot like beer, sometimes even containing hops. Work your way through the draft list as I did on four visits, and you\u2019ll qualify for a Bachelor of Arts in Cider. Advanced degrees are awarded if you become intimately familiar with the bottled products.", "The chef has fixated on the kind of fanciful vegetarian cooking found at fashion-forward places like El Rey, Avant Garden, and Semilla", "In a place so obsessed with alcoholic manifestations of the ruddy pomaceous fruit the food might be an afterthought. Quite the contrary. Wassail is the offspring of Queens Kickshaw in Astoria, and like its parent, vegetarian. The chef, Joseph Buenconsejo, has fixated on the kind of fanciful vegetarian cooking found at fashion-forward places like El Rey, Avant Garden, and Semilla, with dishes in three general sizes, so you may treat Wassail as a snacking spot, small-dish joint, or full-menu restaurant.", "A vegetarian menu seems like a good choice where cider is concerned, matching the beverage\u2019s light flavor and rustic qualities with wholesome and inventive fare.

Indeed, several dishes seem surreal as they appear at the table. There are some normal things, too, including a bread service ($8) featuring three warm sourdough slices and homemade butter, dimpled with buttermilk and strewn with quinoa.", "Many of the chef\u2019s creations depend on mushrooms and such grains as quinoa and farro. The last appears most prominently in a risotto ($18), a vast dark heap with a science-chef egg on top that not so much as bursts, as subsides into the other ingredients.

Time to fist bump and blow it up with Kreuther, the silver-haired fleischschnecke-meister who's flipping the hydraulic pumps and low riding this Rolls through today's lean, mean culinary streets. The past ten years have seen an extraordinary ascendance of smaller, seafood and vegetable-heavy tasting menu spots, from the expensive (Blanca, Brooklyn Fare, Atera), to the affordable (Semilla,\u00a0Contra), while fancy, French-y joints with hopes of getting invited back to the prom (Gordon Ramsay, Adour, Michel Richard) have all failed. Kreuther, by contrast, feels poised for longevity. In fact, a series of recent meals suggest it's well on its way to becoming the next Daniel, Jean-Georges, or Le Bernardin, sating you with familiarity and classic technicality rather than thrilling you with envelope-pushing creativity or strong, spicy flavors.", "Fennel, cockle, and blue shrimp velout\u00e9 with tobiko", "Something to consider: the prix fixe dining room, which could double as a showroom for men's sports jackets, is packed at 9:30 pm on weeknights. But the small plates bar room, where the French-German fare is no less exciting (beer soup with ham hocks!), often feels quite empty. That imbalance suggests that, in Midtown at least, a certain class of diner prefers a spendy four-course meal over a cheaper collection of small plates.

Dinner, as of this week, is $115 for four courses, a hefty jump from this summer's $98 menu. Kreuther, like many others, is hiking its prices as the state's rising minimum wage (among other regulatory burdens) makes the cost of running a restaurant a bit more expensive.

Here's a quick primer on the beverage program at Kreuther.", "1. The perfumed and somewhat unctuous white wines of Alsace (riesling, gewurztraminer, pinot blanc, pinot gris, sylvaner) reign supreme here. A good introduction to the region is the Charles Baur gewurztraminer, with typical notes of lychee and rose ($9/$17)", "2. Kreuther offers four Champagnes at $110 or less: Nicolas Maillart ($92), Christophe Mignon ($110), La Caravelle brut rose ($85), and Ployez Jacquemart ($95)", "3. The beer and cider list is unusually deep for a fine dining restaurant, with 18 selections, three on draft. Try the floral and gently bitter Brasserie Meteor pilsner from Alsace ($13).", "4. The Kunin chenin blanc ($72, 500ml) is one of the hidden gems on the list, with a gorgeous, apricot-like aroma and a hint of tannin from skin contact.", "5. For a cocktail, order the Black Rose ($18), a mix of Ron Zacapa, blackberry, lemon, and just enough rosemary to let you know it's there. Think of it as a more fragrant, slightly more savory riff on a daiquiri.", "Explaining the bar room is simple: It's cheaper; it's for walk-ins; it's where you warm your bones with hearty fare on a cold night. Tart beer soup will do the trick, as will a pile of red wine tripe, a smoky tarte flambee, or a bowl of lobster sauce-drenched saffron pasta. The lounge is without question the chiller place to dine. That's a point worth meditating on, especially as some bemoan the lack of classic comforts in today's modern crop of shouty gastropubs, cramped tasting tables, and other stripped-down gourmet spots.", "For others, myself included, there's a certain burden involved in the more traditional ways of fine dining, where, in between courses, your table is cleared by one person, crumbed by another and liberated of an empty wine glass by a third. Getting from point A to point B at Kreuther can make a guest feel like Moses parting the Red Sea; when you walk to the restroom, so many waiters, managers, and sommeliers discretely step aside, smile, and usher you ahead that you half expect a 21 gun salute after successfully relieving yourself.", "That's not to say Kreuther should change its generous approach to hospitality. But perhaps the restaurant would be more accessible if the bartenders, following the lead of Le Bernardin and Del Posto, encouraged counter patrons to order off the set menu (so they won't miss those more elevated offerings simply because they're more comfortable there) or if wait captains told those in the plusher, prix-fixe dining room to let loose and order off the equally compelling bar menu (especially because the distinction between rustic and refined can be a silly one).

But a young chef will have a heck of a time enjoying Grant Achatz's modernist cookery without visiting Alinea and plucking down $700 on a dinner date.

No blue cheese funk here, just a clean bovine tang and a silky mouthfeel.", "Does any of this come close to upstaging the inventive progression of dishes at Contra, a riskier venue that pumps just as much Phoenix through the sound system? Of course not. But then again, upstaging isn't Wildair's game. It's satisfaction, with a few refined twists, a place to hop in for a glass of wine and a thought-provoking bite (or a traditional plate of schnitzel).

Soon after Jams 2.0 opened, I sat there with a bunch of colleagues from Eater (including three critics, who managed to remain anonymous) and pondered this truth, as we ate our way around the menu.

An ample bacon cheeseburger ($21), named after the restaurant and listed as a bar snack, was fat and juicy and required frequent visits to the cloth napkin, while an oblong pesto-and-goat cheese mini-pizza tasted more Greek than Italian; it was delicious, though, with its smoky crust.

So how can such an ideal site be blighted? SenYa lies directly across the avenue from Sushi Dojo, which caused a furor two years ago when it opened, not only due to its piscine innovations and uni obsessions, but also as a result of its chief itamae's ethnicity.

It's also generally less expensive (though both offer an omakase of 10 pieces for $45), with a wider variety of options, both at the sushi bar and in the kitchen. Mostly eschewing clams and other shellfish, SenYa's omakase favors fin fish, which are often local and off the beaten path as far as the usual sushi selection goes. Served on two sequential pieces of slate, the sushi comes out pre-seasoned, so that no soy sauce, wasabi, or even ginger are really required.

The vinegared rice is pushed into a box called a battera (originally a Dutch word), with the fish carefully planked on top like wooden floorboards. Sometimes gelatin is added to help the sushi set. The lid is put in place and pressure applied. After it achieves firmness, the solid block is removed and cut like a cake into bite-size pieces. This sushi doesn't strive for the lightness of nigiri sushi, but flaunts its rich density. Of the three types offered, best is orange sea trout ($18), with skin that glistens a rainbow of colors.

This plato ranchero ($12) offers an idealized version of the Pueblan diet that harkens to a prosperous past, when a tuck-in after a day of farm chores might include lots of the dried beef called cecina, a bulging chorizo, grilled cactus strips, a plank of white cheese, sauteed onions, and charred jalapenos \u2014 plus rice, beans, corn tortillas, and salad. Phew!", "Plato ranchero.", "In true deli fashion, the sandwiches hog the spotlight, and you can either pick a torta or a cemita, the second invented in Puebla. Priced around $6.50 and served on round seeded rolls that traditionally contained cactus pulp, cemitas are gut-bombs of the highest order. Each is doubly dressed with mayo and refried beans, stuffed with ripe avocado and rubbery cheese, and spiced up with dried chipotle chiles that taste like fiery sundried tomatoes. Plus papalo: astringent green leaves that have the fragrance of burning rubber \u2014 in a good way.", "The one that just might stick in your mind is the cemita Cubana. When I tweeted a picture, one replier noted that the ending in \"Cubana\" is an \"a\" and not an \"o,\" a fact that caused Brigham Barnes to speculate in Lucky Peach that the sandwich was not inspired by the classic Cuban sandwich, which features pernil, boiled ham, Swiss cheese, and dill pickles, but by a street name in Mexico City. Indeed, this cemita Cubana layers on a massive Milanesa beef cutlet, boiled ham, and a hot dog cunningly sliced to resemble bologna, in addition to enough melting queso Oaxaque\u00f1o to float down the river with if you had a tiny boat and paddle. Taking a bite, you might come to the conclusion that the Cubana isn\u2019t a reverential tribute to the Cubano, but an exercise at blatant one-upmanship: \"You think your sandwich is great?

Where once great Gallic behemoths like Lutece, Le Cirque, and La Cote Basque dominated the fine-dining landscape, these places were overtaken with a great whoosh by neophyte New Italian and New American establishments. A great Tuscan craze swept the restaurant industry, emphasizing fresh pastas, seafood, and vegetables in simpler, lighter preparations. Heck, these ascendant cuisines were practically sauceless, decreasing cost and prep time for restaurants increasingly plagued by cash-flow problems. But the tide was bound to turn and French food is making a comeback. With a modern twist, upstarts like Cherche Midi, Lafayette, and Dirty French have ushered in a new age of culinary opulence.", "Mid-priced French bistros are beginning to bounce back, too. While we\u2019ve retained a slender collection of old guard bistros, new ones are materializing, recalibrated to hold their own in today\u2019s small plate and wine bar culture. One such restaurant is Le Baratin (\"The Sweet Talk\"), with a smirking fox logo that seems about to holler, \"This is an ideal place for romantic seduction.\" Le Baratin is located in Greenwich Village, once a hotbed of casual French restaurants. And the place has a pedigree: brothers Michael and Cyril Touchard, two-thirds of the ownership, grew up working with their parents in the Theatre District\u2019s oldest bistro, Tout Va Bien. Like the proprietors of old, they personally tend the bar and patrol the dining room waiting on customers.", "The d\u00e9cor might be termed Parisian kitsch: bicycling jerseys descend from the ceiling, dimpled banquettes march along one bare-brick wall, original works of art alternate with colorful advertising posters, and strings of tiny lights twinkle over the bar. The bill of fare incorporates French standards, but also features a sprinkling of Italian dishes such as gnocchi and pizza. Comprising nine sections, the menu juggles all the classic hors d'oeuvres, cheese and cured-meat platters (that\u2019s the wine-bar angle), and steaks and seafood, among such hoary bistro commonplaces as coq au vin and beef bourguignon.", "Salade Lyonnaise", "You could do worse than order that old warhorse, steak frites ($32). Instead of slinging a rubbery and inexpensive hanger as bistros traditionally have done, Le Baratin fires up a New York strip, consciously treading on steakhouse turf. Well-marbled and tender, the thing comes smothered in a green peppercorn sauce with a bit of piquancy to it. Welcome back, sauces! The accompanying french fries are superb \u2013 scraggly, salty, and slightly greasy. Once the steak has been demolished, there\u2019s nothing better than sopping up the last of your sauce with these unruly fries.", "Other classics find themselves remade in smaller ways. The salade Lyonnaise ($12) topped with a poached egg comes with way more bacon lardons than is traditional, with the dressing toned down so the vinegar doesn\u2019t burn your lips. Call it a tamed frisee salad. The pate maison arrives in a pair of thick chunky slices, a real rustic version sided generously with toasts and a heap of salad. If this were mainly a wine-drinking evening, this could be your whole dinner. Still hungry? Many of the apps come in two portion sizes, so nibbling an order of six snails, or hogging an order of 12, or sharing it with friends, provides plenty of noshing options.", "There\u2019s a rotund flame-grilled burger ($16), too, mounted on a toasted brioche bun, ravished with Russian dressing and wearing a skullcap of camembert \u2013 a choice just as radical in its own way as the Roquefort on the Spotted Pig\u2019s. Other fry-bearing choices include moules frites, featuring some of the plumpest mussels this side of Marseilles.

The noodles are superb, but the beef is dull tasting, and more salt doesn\u2019t help. A high point was a pair of caper-smothered ray filets with a nicely sour tang, complemented with a passel of mixed vegetables. The all-French wine list is exceptional, with lots of action among the Bordeauxs and the Rhones, a good deal of it around $50 and on down. There are plenty of glasses of red, white, sparkling, and rose priced at $10 to $13, and the pour is generous.

Another case in point is pique macho ($15), a massive platter of beef swatches and hot dogs, constituting one of the world's craziest culinary pairings.

Other dishes showing the influence of the Conquistadores include an escabeche mixto of pickled head cheese, pig foot, and vegetables that tastes good in a vinegary sort of way but requires lots of gnawing; it may not be your cup of tea.", "In fact, one of the advantages of Cumbre for a certain type of adventuresome diner is the unreconstructed nature of the food, which hasn\u2019t been gussied up to appeal to a broad spectrum of Americans. Organs, for example, abound. There\u2019s a beef tripe soup using the type known as \"book tripe,\" which might be mistaken for white polyethylene plastic, and a kidney soup laced with cumin, for pee lovers only. Much better is an entr\u00e9e of cow tongue in big tender sheets blanketed with an agreeable sauce made from fresh tomatoes.

The name means \"fake rabbit,\" and the dish must have been invented just after the last bunny was shot in Bolivia, when some resourceful cook decided that a substitution smothered in sauce might go undetected. (Or you could make up your own story.)", "The other improvised sauce, a bit grainy and exceedingly mild in flavor, is made with peanuts. It appears on a couple of Peruvian dishes that swam across the lake, including the beef-heart shish kebabs called anticuchos, and in the in the famous mountain concoction of boiled potatoes, papas ala Huancaina, here replacing the usual cheese sauce. Potatoes and peanuts also recur in a soup with a creamy base that floats french fries like boats on a lake.

Instead of the tuna-paloozas that are common elsewhere (Ichimura is famous for stacking up to three slices on a single piece of rice), Shuko often only serves about two pieces of the meaty delicacy as part of the $135 menu, or three if you count the excellent sinew, which Kim grills over the binchotan and places in a hammock of nori.

But Natarajan has done more to popularize the regional cuisines of his native land than anyone before him, and has also been instrumental in remaking the restaurant scene on lower Lexington Avenue, nicknamed \"Curry Hill\" since the 1980s. The food at his establishments \u2014 at slightly elevated prices \u2014 is frequently excellent.", "Which is why I was disappointed when Bhojan shuttered just as it was gaining traction, and Natarajan replaced it with Haldi, specializing in the food of Calcutta and Bengal. Sprinkled throughout the menu are a small collection of Jewish-Indian delicacies, real critic bait. I was there in a flash. The Indian-Jewish stuff proved OK, though lacking in nuance, but when I brought a Bengali friend to sample the food he'd grown up with, he wrinkled up his nose and exclaimed, \"The curries are well-prepared and wholesome, but the place has got the spicing scheme all wrong!\" And I had to agree: the food tasted way more Punjabi than Bengali, with a dearth of mustard oil and too many entrees awash in brown gravy.", "Accordingly I did what critics must sometimes do and abandoned the project just as I was about to pay my third visit. Instead, I took a chance and dragged myself and my friends to another Natarajan restaurant a few doors down, Kokum. We found an interior decorated with hanging basket lamps and a mural of the high-prowed and brightly painted fishing boats of Kerala, India's southernmost state. The dining room was deep and narrow, with rows of tables along both walls. A bar at the end of the room dispensed beer, wine, and cocktails.

Egg roast ($8.95) is one of the most agreeable apps; boiled specimens halved and heaped with spicy onions, seeming like a worthwhile spin on deviled eggs. Eggs occur in stealthier fashion in egg dosa, a crepe featuring the usual potato filling. But when you cut into it you'll find an egg annealed to the inside of the pancake. In likewise fashion, eggs appear as the star of the show in a biryani; scrambled with tomatoes, chiles, and torn-up flatbread in egg kothu paratha (like some mutant bread pudding); and most spectacularly in egg appam, bowl-shaped breads, each with a runny fried egg at the bottom, sided with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry.", "No matter how many times you visit Kokum, you're likely to stumble on something you'll fall in love with.", "In south Indian cuisines, one also finds many curries thickened with coconut milk as well as lots of homely vegetarian dishes featuring mixtures of rice, lentils, and vegetables.

No, not all culinary institutions age gracefully; just making it to a decade is a triumph. And so that's why I'm happy to report that 27 years after it opened, Hakan Swahn's Manhattan establishment still kicks ass, with a new chef, Emma Bengtsson, who turns out to be a serious gastronomic force to be reckoned with. And really, who could doubt a restaurant named after Swedish vodka?", "Icy shots (I repeat, shots) of that alcoholic beverage still flow freely here \u2014 when was the last time you had shots at Per Se? The caraway and fennel-infused spirit is precisely what to drink with Bengtsson's scallop and sea urchin, a duo of crustaceans that tastes right and relevant even if there's nothing new about this pairing. The diver scallop, one-dimensional and cloying elsewhere, exhibits a powerful brininess here, with a hint of sugar from the Maine urchin and a lick of acidity from a pungent vinaigrette. The whole affair, colored in swaths of green, red, white, and orange, ends up looking like a psychedelic tidal pool somewhere in the North Atlantic, a magical place where the ocean tastes like good balsamic.", "Top: Place setting; Left: Sweetbreads with compressed blue cheese foan; Right: Torched langostines with hay-smoked oysters. All photos by Daniel Krieger", "And so here, alas, it's worth giving credit to the Michelin Guide for putting Aquavit back on my radar, a feat it accomplished by bestowing a rare honor upon Bengtsson \u2014 two stars. That makes her the second woman in America, after Dominique Crenn, to receive that accolade.", "She's not the first chef to make a name for herself at Aquavit. The Midtown mainstay, which opened in 1987 at a Rockefeller townhouse on 54th St., garnered national acclaim in the 1990s under the auspicious reign of chef Marcus Samuelsson, an Ethiopian-born Swede whose \"New Scandinavian Cuisine,\" took a global view of Northern European fare, an approach that resulted in one of the most memorable meals of my life in 2003. I remember Kumamoto oysters with curry mango sorbet, cured salmon with tandoori spices, smoked arctic char in a Japanese-like mushroom consomme, and on a later visit, foie gras lava cake.", "But now, at the 55th St. digs (Aquavit relocated in 2005), we get a different approach to Scandinavia. There's crispy cod skin with bleak roe, fragrant rye crisps with fennel seeds, and bacon-topped pig's blood cakes \u2014 the flavor of boudin noir times five.", "Gravlax with smoke and roe", "Bengtsson, who was previously pastry chef at Aquavit, is continuing the good work of her predecessor, Marcus Jernmark, in producing fare that's leaner, more focused, and more Swedish than Samuelsson's. Her cooking is a happy midpoint between classic European cuisine and the strongly indigenous \"no olive oil let's use sea buckthorn\" New Nordic ethos espoused by Noma's Ren\u00e9 Redzepi. That means no tandoori spices on Bengtsson's chopped gravlax, just a classic hay smoke (for a hint of sweetness), and a garnish of roe (for textural pop and a clean punch of oil). It's nothing groundbreaking. It's just perfect.", "There are just enough jolts of culinary lightening in Bengtsson's cooking to warrant the attention of anyone who cares about fine dining in New York.", "Is Aquavit's food as exciting and compelling as the offerings at Atelier Crenn, Atera, Blanca, Elizabeth, Annisa, the late Aska, or Manresa? Not necessarily, and perhaps that's where Michelin and this critic would disagree. Aquavit's pedestrian, 5 - 6oz lamb chop has no place on an ambitious tasting. And while brined cod with fried anchovy is straight up FlavorTown, the 4oz portion, on the same menu as the lamb, is another gut buster. That's up to ten ounces of protein in two consecutive courses. Not cool. But still. There are just enough jolts of culinary lightening in Bengtsson's cooking to warrant the attention of anyone who cares about fine dining in New York. The price is right too, with a five-course menu at $95, and an eight-course tasting at $135. Order the longer menu, as that's the only way to sample the epic sweetbread preparation. The duck-fat cooked organs are wrapped in compressed fuji apples and topped with a blue cheese foam \u2014 an accidental fondue course. Another highlight: barley risotto with summer truffles, as a rich, earthy, al dente porridge.", "Heirloom tomatoes with horseradish snow", " ", "And for those who haven't dropped by Aquavit in a while, note that the former dining room, a windowless affair that evoked an executive lounge in Corporate Purgatory, is now reserved for private events. Guests now enjoy their three-hour tastings up front in the old bistro room, an airier space overlooking 55th Street. Smart move.", "Another bonus: Should you bring a pocketbook or backpack into the dining room, the wait staff will provide a raccoon fur-covered stool for it to rest upon. It's the type of adornment one might expect for a restaurant that smells like a campfire, which this one does, thanks to a ubiquitous (albeit judicious) use of smoke throughout the meal, perfuming striped bass (good), leek and potato soup (very good) and Swiss chard-wrapped duck leg (even better).", "That duck leg, incidentally, plays a supporting role to a breast boasting such densely crispy skin that I'm halfway tempted to call it the new archetype for this dish throughout the city. And amping up the iron-y funk are tiny bits of crispy duck skin scattered throughout the plate. Cleanse the palate with chili mango aquavit and the evening starts to take on a warm glow.", "Arctic Nest; Petit fours", "The evening improves further with the arrival of the Arctic Nest, a naturalistic riff on the classic Aquavit dessert. In the past guests were served a cylinder of goat fromage parfait topped with blueberry sorbet and a swooping honey tuile. It looked like a modernist sculpture in an overpriced Danish design store. Bengtsson, in turn, has reimagined that delicacy as a goat cheese egg, filled with a \"sea buckthorn\" yolk and all nestled in a tangle of tuiles shaped to resemble a proper avian abode. The tart-sweet-crunchy combo is as good as ever, and so is Aquavit.

For the curator of obscure regional oddities, the steamed dosa ($8.99) might be the perfect thing. Rather than being fried thin and crisp, this pancake has been cooked in a steamer to something pale and spongy.

Striped from the grill and smoky tasting, the pork glistened with saut\u00e9ed scallions; crushed peanuts were heaped on top. Alongside came fresh basil, lime wedges, lettuce leaves, and pickled daikon and carrot.

Based on a long-boiled beef broth, the flavor is ramped up with lemongrass and chili oil, and the broth contains sliced beef, pig knuckles, and congealed pig blood, which resembles wobbly cubes of Jell-O. Don't worry, it won't turn you into a vampire. The rice noodles are thicker and looser than pho, so light you can have a mouthful and almost not be aware of it.

And while the nori wrapped around sea urchin wasn't as crisp as it should have been, you don't mind the oversight much because the Santa Barbara uni had such a crystal clear musk of the sea I'm halfway convinced Daisuke has figured out how to dry-age the orange roe like steaks. ", "What makes Nakazawa a satisfyingly uniform experience is that the head chef personally serves everyone at the bar \u2014 a pleasure that's less common at, say, Ushiwakamaru, where a ninth string sushi chef making spider rolls for the dining room was charged with preparing my $150 omakase a few years back. And at a recent meal at Tanoshi, which didn't cost too much less than Nakazawa, the backup chef started serving me mid-meal using a separate, somewhat mushier stash of rice. That won't happen here. ", "There are also no choices at Nakazawa, and that's something to keep in mind. One of the great things about Manhattan's best sushi restaurants is that dinner is often a dialogue, an interaction between the chef, who asks for preferences, and the guest, who lets the kitchen do most of the driving while putting in a few humble requests. At Nakazawa, the meal is monologue. You sit down and the food starts coming, perhaps a slice of banded grouper or sea bream with kumquat zest.", "This isn't necessarily a bad thing; I've long been a proponent of no-choice menus at Alinea or Atelier Crenn. The question you have to ask yourself, however, is whether you view Daisuke's take on sushi, which emphasizes the more neutral and subtle flavors of the sea, to be a compelling enough narrative to warrant such restrictions. I'd argue it's more exciting to develop a relationship with a good chef like Masato Shimizu of the Michelin-starred 15 East, who can push you outside of your comfort zone while indulging your preference for say, oily and more strongly-flavored silver fish. In other words, Nakazawa isn't necessarily a great choice for regulars looking for a more bespoke experience.", "What also isn't great: When you pick up your first piece of sushi (cherry salmon, served too cold), you discover there's no finger cloth to wipe the remaining rice off your hands \u2014 a waiter corrects the oversight a minute or so later after you look around in confusion.", "Sake sommeliers sometimes do their jobs; they explain that you're drinking a Junmai Kimoto with nice acid; it matches well with richer fish like the clean horse mackerel or the umami-rich saba. Sometimes the sommeliers don't do their jobs; they pour your pairing, utter an unfamiliar name and and walk away before you can even make eye contact or discuss whether it's to your liking. And for those who'd like to peruse the wine or sake offerings in advance, sorry, there's also no online list. ", "Borgognone mentioned during a phone interview that diners are free to order more food after the end of the set menu; that courtesy, common at other omakase sushi spots, was never extended to me during my visits at Nakazawa \u2014 perhaps it's incumbent upon the diners to ask for a second round, which can be a tough proposition when all of a sudden Daisuke drops your dessert sushi and takes a bow. ", "It's not what you'd expect from a four-star restaurant, which Nakazawa most definitely is not. Everyone is pleasant enough and and the food is great, but just as punctuality is slightly more complicated than showing up on time, hospitality is more than being nice. It's about the steps of service and getting them right. It's a skill.

In the late 1930s as the Spanish Civil War wound down, leftist refugees (paradoxically known as \"Republicans\") streamed into Greenwich Village, eager to tell their stories of Fascist persecution. Many started Spanish restaurants there and in surrounding neighborhoods. In addition to formal dining rooms, many of these places \u2014 including Rio Mar in MePa and El Quijote in the Chelsea Hotel \u2014 boasted dark, red-upholstered barrooms where the odor of garlic wafted through like an ocean breeze. While the dining rooms were busy peddling massive servings of paella to hungry, cash-strapped bohos, the bars served snacks to homesick Spaniards, including grilled sardines, flaming chorizos, and poached octopus washed down with wines, sherries, and sangria.", "Numbering perhaps two dozen, these combo restaurants and tapas bars dominated the city's Iberian food scene for 60 years, until a startling event occurred. A decade ago Mario Batali launched Casa Mono (\"Monkey House\"), a newfangled type of tapas bar with no restaurant attached, serving regional Spanish small plates with Italian twists. The orange-clogged dude also took what had been a placid institution and added a new level of theatricality, allowing you to admire a cook flipping coxcombs on a broad griddle. And Casa Mono elevated the runny poached egg to a pinnacle it would never descend from.", "Not long after Boqueria debuted, named after a Barcelona market. If Casa Mono was a carefully constructed one-act play, Boqueria was a three-ring circus. The minute you came in the door, there was a gal madly slicing things in the front window, and the entire place \u2014 which featured raised tables and felt like an airline departure lounge \u2014 was constantly abuzz. But though small plates of charcuterie, bread dips, and pan con tomate attracted the most attention, these places and the imitators that soon followed insisted on backsliding on the promise of a real tapas bar by offering full-blown entrees that competed with the small plates.", "These two establishments begat the modern New York tapas bar, where you were invited not only to graze but to sit down and eat a full meal. But with international attention currently swinging from Catalonia's Ferran Adria to the Basque country's Andoni Luis Aduriz, it was inevitable that some new restaurant would want to chuck the sit-down menu and take these institutions back to their roots in the famous pintxo bars of San Sebastian. That place is Donostia.", "Located at the northeast corner of Tompkins Square Park, Donostia is the Basque-language name of the city and tourist mecca of San Sebastian. In case you didn't get the message, an antique map of the Basque territory is repeated three times on the wall. The bar is gray-splotched white marble. The lighting consists of tortured metal globes like an eagle's talon in the deep narrow barroom, and a nifty chandelier made of wine glasses in a semi-private room toward the back. A third room allows tapas eaters to survey the bare-bones food prep area. With the facade flung open in fine weather, the place takes full advantage of the park, and there's nothing quite like sitting at one of the raised tables in front drinking a glass of sweet sherry and nibbling a pintxo or two as the sun sinks behind the Temperance Arch.", "The function of a real tapas bar? It's a place to have a drink or two in the evening and a handful of snacks selected for their sharp flavor and eye-appeal. The food represents a hunger-deterrer, not a meal. The same implied advice pertains to Donostia: Have a drink or two, but don't try to eat dinner, because if you do, you'll be disappointed. But as a place to snack and explore the alcoholic beverages of Spain, Donostia is unparalleled. The food menu sprawls across two folio pages in a whopping 17 categories, but is reducible to a small collection of dried, pickled, and canned ingredients repeated in several small-plate formats. Don't expect any of the current dining tropes of fresh, local, or sustainable to be observed. This contrariness alone makes Donostia worth visiting.", "When you first arrive, stick with Banderillas (\"flags,\" $2 to $4), delightful toothpick-borne combinations of one or two bites, and Montaditos ($2 to $6), open-faced sandwiches of three or four. In the former category be charmed by gilda: two green olives and two pickled peppers skewered with an anchovy \u2013 a pintxo that originated in San Sebastian in the 1940s named after a Rita Hayworth movie; and chorizo picante: a single slice of spicy sausage, a wedge of aged manchego, and a streamer of pimento. These banderillas look like miniature chivalric pennants carried into a battle of flavors. The montaditos are similarly compelling, edible bread-mounted sculptures on which you might find a dab of salt-cod puree, a tentacle of octopus, brine-pickled cherry tomatoes, blue-veined cabrales cheese, a baton of eerily white asparagus, or the best canned sardine you've ever tasted.", "", "You can also discover culinary nirvana in the Pates section, which means in one instance a glass crock of whipped artichoke dip flooded with olive oil and served with a small flock of toasts. Another high point are the weird-ass sandwiches made with a pair of tortilla wedges, one example with a filling of creamed leeks and spinach constituting the menu's biggest feed. You also can't go wrong with the charcuterie assortment called plato de carne y queso ($20). A friend who's spent time in San Sebastian noted that the tapas bars there whet your hunger with trays displaying snacks stacked on every available surface. While our own health department prohibits this sort of sumptuous display, the bar at Donostia features several selections on cake-display platters under glass. You could do worse than ignore the confusing bill of fare entirely and adopt a point-and-eat strategy.", "Ultimately, the menu at Donostia is more about the booze. That part of the menu is a didactic document with voluminous special sections for red and white wines, ciders, beers, sangrias, and sherries (wonderful fortified wines that run from bone-dry to raisin sweet). Sampling the full range of beverages at Donostia could take a lifetime. My advice: Get started!", "To misquote an adage, \"Good things sometimes come in twos,\" and that is true of Basque tapas bars in the East Village. Not long after Donostia opened, an olive's throw away on First Avenue a place called Huertas (\"Orchards\") appeared, also claiming to be a Basque tapas bar. The interior makes artful use of dark woods and antique mirrors using bare brick as a backdrop. Huertas attracted lots of attention by its method of addressing the visual display problem by creating something called \"passed tapas,\" whereby pintxos would be placed on trays and carried through the barroom ($2 to $4). These were available in addition to medium-size dishes called raciones, which could be ordered from the kitchen.", "Huertas has a beautiful gilda, too, with a little more emphasis on the anchovy, and individual mussels escabeche awash in white vinegar and chopped aromatics. The only dud here was the spongy hake croquette resting in a puddle of indifferent garlic mayo. There tend to be eight passed tapas listed on the chalkboards, and an additional 10 raciones, plus charcuterie and cheese, making the menu in the front room much easier to digest than Donostia's. As an added boon, some of the sea creatures featured are fresh and imported from Spain. Foremost in strangeness are percebes, gooseneck barnacles that look like a baby alien that has just gnawed its way through your stomach. The flesh squeezed from its neck is sweet, but the price of four or five small specimens priced at $13 is too steep. The best dish among the raciones is something called migas, featuring tidbits of duck and croutons tossed in a verdant green sauce, with fresh pea shoots on top.  Brilliant! Fresh is not a dirty word at Huertas, as it is at Donostia.", "", "The list of Spanish alcohol is much shorter at Huertas; nevertheless, there is good cider, sherry, and vermouth (the latter on tap), and the barman is well versed in the selections available. Then there's the back room, which is reserved for a single prix-fixe meal ($52) in the faddish modern style, which flies in the face of the tapas tradition, though it serves as a reminder you're in the East Village rather than San Sebastian \u2014 as if you'd forgotten.", "", "Lucky for us, the four-course feed via chef Jonah Miller verges on the superb. It begins with radishes served with whipped parsley butter as a prelude, then progresses to the first course: three small pintxos, including, on this occasion, a gilda, a toast with an agreeable puddle of foie gras, and a single mussel escabeche served in a soup spoon. The second course is a variation on the duck and pea-shoot migas of the raciones menu. So far, the meal has been a triumph, but it threatens to run off the rails with the third and largest course, which is not quite big enough to qualify as an entr\u00e9e. This is the first course offering a selection of three, and my dining companion and I enjoyed a sliced duck breast with greens and golden raisins in a broth that threatened to be sweet, but wasn't. Less satisfactory was a grease-sodden vegetarian rice dish featuring pickled mushrooms squiggled with mayo, presented in a miniature paellera, suggesting once again that tapas bars shouldn't meddle in main dishes. The final course was a return to fine form, with three choices, from which we picked a pair of small cakes draped with pickled rhubarb and a cheese plate offering three bang-up selections with membrillo and a dab of honey.", "Taken as a pair, Donostia and Huertas give a good idea of what dining in San Sebastian might be like, without jacking up your frequent flyer miles. Thus, your best bet is to graze at both places in succession, which I did one evening with a promenade around the park in between.

And Bloomfield isn't sending out those little lollipop chops you stole off the hors d'oeuvre platter at your uncle's wedding. This lamb is a proper chop, pounded like veal Milanese and painted green with spicy cilantro chutney. Don't expect medium-rare mush in your mouth, this flattened affair is a study in the occasional deliciousness of eating something medium-well. The chop has big-steak heft, big-game flavor, and a world of fragrant heat from the verdant chutney.", "Lamb chop; roast beef", "Now that your palate is primed you can move onto that rare roast beef \u2014 the original American answer to carpaccio. The kitchen gently warms the crimson slices and drapes them over fat-fried onion bread. The beef tastes of blood, and horseradish cream is your ultra-rich mayo substitute.", "Step three: Order the saltimbocca. A sheet of nutty prosciutto covers a layer of sage-infused pork so thin I'm certain Bloomfield could market this nationwide as carnivorous fruit-roll-up. And what a school snack this would be; the savory juices squirt out as you masticate, like MSG-laced chewing tobacco.", "None of this food looks new but it all tastes new and that's the genius of Bloomfield and her resident chef, Christina Lecki, who prove that British-accented pub fare, however rustic, can feel just as refined and boundary pushing as the American avant-garde. Sure, there are other great meateries in New York, and if you combined DBGB, Bar Boulud, and restaurant Daniel into a fearsome Lyonnaise Voltron you might have the greatest. But that unlikely scenario notwithstanding, it's worth noting that The Breslin, five years after opening, has grown into the best place to eat meat in The Big Apple, period.", "The bill of fare reads like a dead dog's breakfast in the high-class canine afterlife. At any given time The Breslin sells up to five terrines, four sausages, two meat pies, two to three types of lamb, pork fat-fried peanuts, pork rinds, pork shoulder, a whole suckling pig dinner that starts at $680 before tax and tip, and a prime rib feast that starts at $760.", "My suggestion: do the curried lamb supper, which feeds eight for $640. The entry fee guarantees access to those killer chops, flaky samosas, saag aloo, and a cannonball-sized Kashmiri leg of lamb that you wrap up in buckwheat parathas and eat like a taco. The large-format affair is like a tasting menu served all at once, the culinary equivalent of binge watching \"House of Cards.\" Your ideal pairing: a chilled glass of gamay for $11.", "", "Seafood sausage", "There are a few fish items on the menu too, and the best one of course is a sausage. The butter-drenched seafood brat is a crack blend of shrimp, scallops and lobster. Testament to Lecki's cooking is how each component sings through with remarkable clarity; it's how you wished frutti di mare would taste at Italian restaurant but never does. Lecki also makes a mean merguez sausage, topped with lemon breadcrumbs to counter the smoky harissa. She sends out a mild blood sausage, which practically crumbles itself into a runny egg. And she forges a forearm-sized pig's foot sausage, scented with nutmeg, fried and paired with spicy pickled vegetables. That $49 trotter for two is less about musky flavor of pork and a more about sticky, gelatinous, stomach warming bliss; leftovers will last for days.", "Keep in mind that The Breslin's reservations policy* is pretty much identical to sister spot The Spotted Pig: It doesn't take them for the most part. And nor should it. Friedman and Bloomfield cater to hungry diners rather than plan-ahead people who insist on booking casual steak dinners 30-days out (and then cancel them). So don't be the plan-ahead person. Just swing by The Breslin in off-hours. I usually head over around 10:30 p.m. or later and grab a bar seat right away.", "The lamb burger; Scallions with Romesco sauce", "Is the grass-fed lamb burger sitting in front of every third patron? That's because it's just as compelling as it was when it debuted back in 2009; a side of cumin mayo lets you double down on the locker-room odor and the medium-rare meat is so soft it's almost as if you're eating a hot terrine on a bun. It's not as easygoing as an everyday beef burger and that's why The Breslin surely ranks with Ma Peche as New York's most envelope-pushing hotel restaurant; such establishments usually cater to a more conservative crowd.", "Instead of chicken fingers The Breslin gives us scrumpets, fried batons of fatty lamb meant for dipping in mint vinegar. Instead of gussied-up pot pies for $36 we get stinky beef stilton pies for $9. And instead of a typical Caesar salad Bloomfield gives us an essay in fish oil, packing her croutons with more anchovy flavor than a jar full of anchovies. The lesson is this: Great chefs don't always ask diners what they want, they tell diners what they want, and if you disagree with that you can go to the local IHOP and build your own stack of pancakes.", "For a number of years, my barometer for the official start of winter was whenever Bloomfield decided to put her bone marrow soup on the menu. Now that it's summer, The Breslin is doing a thin corn and squash soup. Skip it, and take a pass on the hen of the woods mushrooms with prosciutto too. Remember, you're here to eat meat, like a summery stew of swine. Lecki uses milk as her weapon, braising the pig down to the texture of pillows, and coaxing a riot of sage into a soft, herbal sweetness. Time for bed.", "Or perhaps it's time for steak. The Breslin's ribeye for two, cooked in its own fat in a steel pan, has a dry-aged funk that's detectable before it hits the table and that lingers on your fingers for hours after. The meat doesn't quite have the same level of concentrated minerality that I fell in love with at Roberta's, but it's still a class-A cut. It boasts a level of fattiness that mandates a tannic California syrah ($16) as much as it does a Widow Jane Manhattan. Or perhaps more importantly, such bovine brilliance is yet another reminder to all the hedge funders and tourists tossing their money under the broilers at Del Frisco's, Wolfgang's, or STK that our city's best steaks are not to be found in steakhouses, but rather at restaurants with actual chefs.", "", "Ants on a Log.

A pig carcass sat in the center, stripped to its bones like a garbage pail skeleton in a Heathcliff cartoon. It was a very particular type of haute-junkyard carnage that made me wonder whether the Breslin could do away with custodial staff and let in a herd of stray cats at night to do the cleaning.

One bite and you'll wrinkle up your nose; by the second you may or may not love it.", "Similarly spicy, but not so fishy, is kua kling, a dish that undermines our ideas of what constitutes a curry. The recipe is typical of the unusual dry curries of southern Thailand. Instead of being mixed with sweet coconut milk, the ground pork (or beef or chicken) is cooked in a curry paste with a small amount of water, along with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves, until the meat turns damp but not soupy. The accompanying cucumbers and lettuce are used to scoop up bites, serving to partly staunch the burn. Though kua kling outwardly resembles an Isaan larb, the dish is much more variegated in its flavoring.", "But not all the curries from this region are spicy. Showing the influence of Indian food on southern Thai, gaeng massaman (the second word is a corruption of \"Muslim\") is a mild curry of beef, potatoes, and peanuts principally flavored with onions and coconut milk. Mellowed with turmeric, yellow curry (gaing karee, $10 to $13 depending on principal ingredient) is also tender to the tongue, and unspeakably rich. Malaysian and Indonesian fare also inform the food of the southern region. Maybe you'll be surprised to hear there's a version of Malaysian roti canai called roti panang nuea ($7) featuring the same flaky pancake. But instead of the soupy chicken curry that usually comes alongside, there's a more substantial serving of a coconut-thickened beef stew that will remind you of Indonesian rendang.", "Fried shrimp cakes", "Other apps are similarly lively. You've never eaten bigger or better curry puffs ($4) \u2013 three hefty crescents of puff pastry stuffed with poultry that may owe something to the early Dutch colonial presence in the region; then again they may be Spanish or even British in origin \u2013 they look like Cornish pasties. Part of the lure of Southeast Asian food is its wild mixture of influences, aboriginal, colonial, and modern international. Other delectable southern Siamese snacks include deep-fried shrimp cakes and chicken wings lacquered with turmeric and fish sauce.", "What about the Isaan cook laboring side-by-side with the southern cook in the kitchen? He rocks the green peppercorns \u2013 which look like little trees \u2013 in several notable recipes, including a stew of wild boar called pad ped moo pha ($13), which might be one of New York's hottest dishes. It left one of my guests hiccupping after a few bites. Another northern dish worth ordering is ka prow ka moo, a thick slurry of pork knuckle, fiery fresh chiles, and basil in a thick sweet soy sauce. It's so rich with pork fat that even after blotting your lips afterwards you'll still feel like they've been injected with Botox.", "Kitchen 79 has unusual d\u00e9cor.

There's no magic trick here, this is not some highfalutin Ferran Adri\u00e0-inspired course where the squid ink colored dust rehydrates into beluga caviar when it reacts with saliva. These are actual ashes, albeit ones forged from lamb heart. The organ has been cured, shaved, and placed under flaming bedstraw for so long that it hasn't so much been cooked as it's been cremated.

He means that, he says, \"in the best possible way.\"", "Allow me to describe it a little differently: The white paste is sweet and silky. Pickled celery root adds a gentle tang. And then the noir carcinogens start working their magic. It doesn't taste like anything at first, but as I swallow, the gentle musk of sheep lingers on your palate, like a final dying breath, and then disappears.", "I ask Berselius what inspired the dish. He replies that he'd like to get philosophical. I tell him to go ahead. And he explains that, while watching a blood red dusk in the Western Catskills, he envisioned a sheep being set ablaze as it walked into the sun.", "A prevailing \u2014 and not inaccurate \u2014 narrative of the New York dining scene is that the rapidly rising cost of running a restaurant here has produced increasingly uniform restaurants, including infinite Italian spots, sushi parlors, steakhouses, and fast casual joints serving fried chicken sandwiches. This is not a time to take risks; this is a time to stay in business.", "And yet, amid the tough realities of running a restaurant, restless Brooklyn chefs (along with a few wily crews in Manhattan) are fighting against the mainstream-ization of food, opening up creative and challenging establishments.

We saw this with carrot crepes and watermelon sushi at\u00a0Olmsted.", "And now we're at the naturalistic Aska, where you half expect the chef to remove a floorboard, hand you a piece of sandpaper, and tell you to inhale as much moss-laced sawdust as you like.

Berselius eventually changed the name to its current one, established it as a permanent-ish space, and received a Michelin star for, among other things, pig's blood crackers, pig's blood terrine, and sea buckthorn purees. But it closed in early 2014 to find a larger, more comfortable venue, a process that ended up taking bit longer than expected (it always does). Well now Berselius is cooking again. And the pig's blood is back \u2014\u0080\u0094 not just as dessert truffles, but as a sweet, funky, coagulated, rose-topped pancake.", "Aska 2.0\u00a0opened in August just underneath the Williamsburg bridge. The bi-level space, a restored 1860s warehouse and garden, gives the 37-year-old Berselius a chance to prove to New York that he deserves to be taken as seriously as the city's best chefs. He does, and he charges accordingly: The restaurant's signature offering is a $215 service-included menu that diners fully pre-pay for when reserving. Add on wine pairings and dinner for two is $718.", "That price includes a sharp parting gift: a grey ceramic cheese knife. When I returned for a second visit, my waiter handed me a white knife. They both sit in my cutlery drawer alongside my caviar spoons and truffle shaver. I stare at them all with envy when I reach for a pair of takeout chopsticks.", "With such lofty prices come not just regiftable utensils but sleek, Scandinavian-chic hunting lodge environs. A candle sits in the curl of deer antler. A reindeer skull lies above the open kitchen. A cute little Swedish flag sits on the bar across tall cylinders of marigold and birch-infused aquavit (they taste like liquid bonfire). Sheep pelts adorn smooth wood chairs. Good cookbooks (Manresa, Benu), lie just within reach of both my table and the toilet (though it's too dark to read inside the latter \u0080\u0094\u2014 for the best). And overhead track lighting makes every table a mini-Instagram studio. An outdoor garden lets a Catskills-based ceramics artist spin ultra-local pottery for dinner service.", "Proximity to product is important here, most of the time. When I ask for a shaken cocktail I learn that Aska only serves stirred potables. The bartender says bringing in carts of citrus wouldn't be local or efficient.", "Later that evening, I'm slurping down caviar so delicate it has the texture and tremble of panna cotta.

Is this an undiscovered breed of New York State caviar?", "\"It's from Finland.\"", "There are certain laws to the contemporary gastronomic universe. Bread in a la carte restaurants won't be free. Avocado toast at breakfast won't be cheap. And if you're in a Nordic-leaning restaurant in New York, it probably serves a tasting menu. It's a heck of a thing, really: New York City is so over-saturated with fine dining restaurants that it has five of them (that's five more than many U.S. cities) dedicated to a subregion of Europe that most gourmands didn't care about until Rene Redzepi opened Noma in Copenhagen and started serving lemongrass-flavored live ants for lunch.", "Those five Nordic tasting spots are, incidentally, the two-decade-old\u00a0Aquavit (as excitingly smoky as ever), Greenpoint's\u00a0Luksus (where the only beverage is beer), Tribeca's Danish-inflected\u00a0Atera (think: eel-filled aebelskivers and mushrooms that hover above the plate), Grand Central's\u00a0Agern (which caters to those who want a tasting menu in a train station), and now\u00a0Aska, which offers the longest tasting of them all, at 19 courses.", "I should point out there are cheaper ways of dining here. Shortly after opening, Berselius introduced a shortened, 10-course menu for $145. And downstairs, where a butterflied seal skin procured by the bartender's mother acts as a throw rug, Aska offers a la carte lounge plates. The lounge, \"is where the neighborhood gathers,\" the website states, and those who recoil in the exorbitance of the North Williamsburg waterfront district will smirk at the notion of locals dropping by for $18 cocktails and $4.50 oysters \u2014 add on tax and you're at $59 per dozen.", "[Clockwise from the top left: scallop with its own roe in brown butter; birchwood ice cream with mushroom; Finnish caviar with onion consomme; pork belly with roasted onion, dill, and pickles on a malt roll (from the bar menu).]", "Each Montauk Pearl is cleanly shucked, topped with a pickled currant, and squirted with just enough juniper oil to make you wonder whether these bivalves were harvested from a magical underwater coniferous tree growing deep in Long Island Sound. They're perfect. But really, charging as much for a one bite dish as you might for two empanadas is a great way to make people swear off service-included pricing forever, even if everything else in the bar room is often a steal, and occasionally a masterpiece.", "A pesto-and-sour-cream smeared pancake is studded with cubes of dry-aged beef that were funkier and more expertly marbled than any $60 dry-aged steak I've had this year. The pancake, a light meal, costs just $14.", "The true magic, of course, happens upstairs.", "A waiter hands you a pair of scissors and tells you to cut open a bouquet of blowtorched chamomile and yarrow. Inside lies a barely-cooked langoustine that tastes like sugar and pine. You drag it with your hands through a sauce made from its head, and the flavor of the sea reappears, albeit gently. Berselius, when working with seafood, is a master of pacing, teasing you with a sandy breeze before knocking you over with a bone crunching wave, then repeating it all over again.", "After the langoustine comes that private jet tidal pool of Finnish caviar \u2014\u0080\u0094 a delicate but assertive taste of the sea. Then he cranks up the ocean level big time with a chaud-froid scallop, hot and seared on top while cold on the bottom and drenched in brown butter. It's an accessible study in shellfish sweetness until you bite into a red gob of scallop roe, which, unlike trout roe, packs a low tide unctuousness that recalls a sundried horseshoe crab that's been picked apart by seagulls. I mean that, to borrow a Berselius term, \"in best possible way.\"", "The chef dials things back with a \"drive through the Swedish countryside\": poached skate wing rolled in wood sorrel, bronze fennel, cosmos petals, and flowering dill. It's\u0080\u0094 a short herbal reprieve until the wave hits again, in the form of concentrated crab consomm\u00e9     and a fat slice of Norwegian king crab. It tastes of salt and clean guts. Moments later you're handed a squid and kelp tart with violets. It tastes of the ocean and dirty (but delicious) guts.", "Things get blurry. A skin contact wine here. Some booze-free birch water there. Maybe another shot of aquavit. \"Wolf Like Me\" blasts through the sound system as you spoon your way through a kataifi-like nest of lichens over cooked cream and mushroom broth. The aroma stings of juniper and bitter forest while the flavors evoke an earthy dessert.", "Maybe dry-aged beef comes later. Or maybe it'll be hay-grilled woodcock \u2014 with a warning to watch out for hunter's pellets.", "A waiter politely asks if he may remove the bread and whipped lardo \u2014 eight times the strength of barbecue pulled pork \u2014\u0080\u0094\u00a0before a scoop of birchwood ice cream with mushrooms arrives.

Perhaps you never went in the first place, because you thought a $1,000 dinner date was elitist and foolish. But many of you indulged. Per Se, after all, wasn't a Lamborghini, an out-of-reach-acquisiton that makes the buyer look like a jerk; Per Se was a night out to see Hamilton: a cultural phenomenon that middle-class food-o-philes saved up for. It was a place to understand old French indulgences (foie gras, truffles) and to seek fluency in new American luxuries (sous-vide short ribs, cryovac melons). Then the prices went up and the food went downhill. The New York Times published a devastating pan, and this critic said the tired cuisine was about what one would expect out of a high-end shopping mall.

A layer of trout mousse underneath coats your palate, tempering all the unctuous excess. This is when you realize that chef Cesar Ramirez is subtly telling you that he can do better than Keller.

At Brooklyn Fare, there's no extra charge; every diner is privy to these buttery, barely briny beads. With a flick of the tongue, they evaporate like a summertime tidal pool.", "New York's tasting menu venues, predominantly fancy, French-y, Midtown institutions in the early aughts, gave way to stripped-down American counter spots in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn in the decade that followed, with longer menus and smaller portions catering to our shorter social media attention spans. As rooms shrank, the number of courses seemed to grow, giving risk-taking chefs more room to experiment. This reality, alas, also produced syllable-sized dishes served at such a rapid pace they sometimes felt like real-time slideshows of food, edible press releases designed to be instantly preserved in the electronic amber of Instagram. Eat, snap, forget.", "Brooklyn Fare, which opened in 2009 next to its namesake market, exemplified many of these trends, both good and bad. Patrons sat on hard metal chairs around a U-shape counter. Ramirez, late of Bouley, pitched up to thirty courses of French-Japanese fare at a breakneck pace. The tone was dinner-party strict. Ramirez would wait until everyone quieted to announce each course. Guests who were twenty minutes late would find themselves seven courses behind. (I once double fisted a few bites to catch up.) No pictures or note-taking were allowed; when I asked about this a few years back, Ramirez just smiled and quipped, \"I just want everyone to leave their guns at the door.\" The lack of a liquor license meant diners brought their own wines, chilled their own wines (you had to make cute little snow mountains with crushed ice to chill the bottlenecks), and poured their own wines. And this was all okay, because dinner for two wouldn't run more than $500.", "Inside Brooklyn Fare", "Then Brooklyn Fare started serving wine. And as the economy rebounded, the cost of dinner inched up further. What was once one of the city's best bargains turned into one of our most expensive establishments. Dinner is now $306 per person, service included, which means a fully-loaded dinner for two, with beverage pairings, can scratch at $1,000. And that's okay, because while Per Se, at $325, has done little to merit its increasingly higher prices over the years, Brooklyn Fare has transformed itself from a lean, underdog chef's counter into one of the city's most comfortable and compelling expressions of haute cuisine.", "Black leather stools now allow for more comfortable feasting. Zalto stems stand tall in front of every guest. Sommeliers glide to and fro, picking out steely whites to pair with slices of gently charred mackerel. The slower pace and shorter course count (around fifteen plates or so), affords each dish more time for conversation and contemplation. That's hugely important if you believe that Ramirez's cuisine deserves a place in our ongoing culinary conversations, a tough standard to meet for a chef with no cookbook to reinforce our memories of his delicacies, few media appearances to tout his likeness, and a strict photo policy that keep his innovations somewhat under the radar.", "Wagyu, a majestic bovine breed whose flesh is as marbled as bluefin tuna belly, has developed somewhat of a reputation in New York, where it often precedes the word \"meatball\" or \"slider.\" At Brooklyn Fare, Ramirez sets us all straight, serving an insanely expensive A5 Miyazaki over grated daikon and horseradish. The cut is so gorgeously fatty you could practically spread it over toast like marrow. The robust roots underneath, in turn, slice through the Wagyu's richness like the tart-spicy condiments on a roast beef sandwich.", "Above: Hokkaido uni toast with black truffle and a chef slicing Miyazaki Wagyu; Below: Chefs prepare frozen soufflees for dessert and lobster poached in shiso butter with apple", "Classic indulgences like caviar, truffles, and foie gras have slowly disappeared from tasting menus as our notions of luxury evolve to include more sustainable excesses like house-aged game, repurposed food waste, oily fish, and custom vegetables from bespoke farms. Of the city's long tasting menu venues, only Per Se and Brooklyn Fare consistently act as an immersion class into these high-end commodities of yesteryear. So it's a shame that you when show up for those marquee ingredients at Per Se they can cost up to $300 extra per person.", "At Brooklyn Fare there are no two-tiered culinary experiences, no supplemental charges. Ramirez tops sweet hokkaido uni with the earthy funk of black truffle in August, or the more ethereal musk of white truffle in December. Each dish is just a bite, yet the flavors linger for minutes. Foie gras is included in the tasting as well, its livery oomph giving weight to a mind bending black truffle and king crab chawanmushi. And then white truffles appear again in a scoop of ice cream infused with the heady tuber, a single scoop that costs an extra $68 at Masa in Manhattan.", "Chef Cesar Ramirez", "But while Ramirez lures us in with such goodies, he quietly wows with more subdued surprises: a soft bite of abalone in a sauce of its own liver. He slow cooks a slice of deep sea snapper but leaves the scales intact, letting the marshmallow texture of the flesh contrast with the rough exterior, crisped up like maritime baklava. The chef, always dressed in a white button-down and black-framed glasses, cherishes unexpected crunches. He strolls over as I notice how the skin on a duck breast is a bit more cooked than usual. \"It's a chicharron, man,\" he says, before turning around and walking away. It was, without a doubt, the closest thing to a mic drop I've experienced in my decade of eating out professionally.", "The meal eventually winds down. Shiso sorbet, spun in the PacoJet, is smooth as velout\u00e9.

By this point Ramirez is working  the room, chatting with every guest, shaking hands with everyone as they leave. Ramirez has, it should be noted, been accused of various things over the years, ranging from\u00a0racism to making\u00a0a guest cry (allegations which he's denied). I've visited Brooklyn Fare seven times since it opened (twice these past five months) and I've only encountered a chef so hospitable I once named him\u00a0my favorite waiter.", "Give Ramirez credit: he's turned his Tasting Temple by Cesar into something larger, a proper restaurant that's less about the chef and more about the guest, and a venue that still feels as relevant as ever as its strengths switch from the cutting edge (which it still embodies) to the classic (which it's becoming).
