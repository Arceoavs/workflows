### CONTRIBUTION TO BIGGORILLA
------------------------------

BigGorilla is an open-source framework for data integration
and data preparation tasks. We encourage all researchers,
engineers, professors and students who work on data preparation
and data integration tasks to contribute to BigGorilla. To make
sure your contribution can be easily deployed by others, the
BigGorilla team will review and test your code. Please read the
following instructions before submitting your contribution.

* If you are submitting a sample workflow, you need to create a
new folder under the "workflows" folder.
* If you are submitting a python package make sure that you create
a new folder with the name of your package under the "packages" folder.
* Include a file titled "Authors.txt" inside your folder and mention
the creators as well as any publications that should be cited for
academic purposes.
* If your submission uses large datasets, make sure to host them
somewhere else and point to them in your submission (in a README file).
* Note that by submitting your work, you are making it public for
everyone and can be used for commercial as well as non-commercial and
academic use.
